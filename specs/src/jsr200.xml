    <title>Pack200: A Packed Class Deployment Format For Java Applications</title>
    <documentation source="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=200">This document specifies an archive format called "Pack200". It is optimized for applications written in the Javatm programming language. Such applications are usually delivered as collections of classes, sometimes with associated resource files. This format allows any number (from one to hundreds of thousands) of Java classes to be encoded by a compressor, transmitted compactly in a single block of bytes, and decoded by a decompressor into equivalent Java class files. Because it can also represent class resources and other "side files", it can serve as an alternative to the JAR archive for some deployment tasks, notably downloading Java applications.</documentation>

        <documentation source="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=200">The Pack200 format can decrease the size of a Java application by a factor of seven to nine, compared with an equivalent JAR containing uncompressed ("stored") class files. By contrast, using the zip DEFLATE algorithm integral to JAR and ZIP archives gains a factor of two.</documentation>
