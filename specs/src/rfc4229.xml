    <title>HTTP Header Field Registrations</title>
    <documentation source="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4229">HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 define protocol constructs (respectively, the HTTP-header and message-header BNF rules) that are used as message headers.  These specifications also define a number of HTTP headers themselves, and they provide for extension through the use of new field-names. This document defines the initial contents of an IANA registry that catalogs permanent HTTP header field-names, and of an IANA repository that catalogs provisional HTTP header field-names.  Both are operated according to Registration Procedures for Message Header Fields.</documentation>
