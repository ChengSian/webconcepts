    <title>HTTP Client Hints</title>
    <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-grigorik-http-client-hints">An increasing diversity of connected device form factors and software capabilities has created a need to deliver varying, or optimized content for each device. Client Hints can be used as input to proactive content negotiation; just as the Accept header allowed clients to indicate what formats they prefer, Client Hints allow clients to indicate a list of device and agent specific preferences.</documentation>

        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-grigorik-http-client-hints#section-2">The "CH" request header field describes an example list of client preferences that the server can use to adapt and optimize the resource to satisfy a given request. The CH field-value is a comma-delimited list of header fields, and the field-name values are case insensitive.</documentation>
