    <title>Link Relation Types for Web Services</title>
    <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-service-link-rel">Many resources provided on the Web are part of a sets of resources that are provided in a context that is defined and managed by one particular service provider. Often, these sets of resources are referred to as "Web Services" or "Web APIs". This specification defines two link relations that allow to represent relationships from those resources to ones that provide documentation or descriptions of the Web services. The difference between these concepts is that documentation is primarily intended for human consumers, whereas descriptions are primarily intended for automated consumers.</documentation>
    <link-relation def="service-doc">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-service-link-rel#section-4.1">The "service-doc" link relation type is used to represent the fact that a resource is part of a bigger set of resources that are documented at a specific URI. The target resource is expected to provide documentation that is intended for human consumption.</documentation>
    </link-relation>
    <link-relation def="service-desc">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-service-link-rel#section-4.2">The "service-desc" link relation type is used to represent the fact that a resource is part of a bigger set of resources that are described at a specific URI. The target resource is expected to provide a service description that is intended for machine consumption. Very often, it is provided in a format that is consumed by tools, code libraries, or similar components.</documentation>
