title:       "Pack200: A Packed Class Deployment Format For Java Applications"
description: "This document specifies an archive format called \"Pack200\". It is optimized for
applications written in the Javatm programming language. Such applications are usually
delivered as collections of classes, sometimes with associated resource files. This
format allows any number (from one to hundreds of thousands) of Java classes to be
encoded by a compressor, transmitted compactly in a single block of bytes, and decoded
by a decompressor into equivalent Java class files. Because it can also represent
class resources and other \"side files\", it can serve as an alternative to the JAR
archive for some deployment tasks, notably downloading Java applications."
