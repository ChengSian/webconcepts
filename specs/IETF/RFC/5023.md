## Specified Web Concepts:

### Media Types

[`application/atomcat+xml`](/concepts/media-type/application/atomcat+xml "An Atom Publishing Protocol Category Document, when serialized as XML 1.0, can be identified with the following media type."), [`application/atomsvc+xml`](/concepts/media-type/application/atomsvc+xml "An Atom Publishing Protocol Service Document, when serialized as XML 1.0, can be identified with the following media type.")

### Link Relations

[`edit`](/concepts/link-relation/edit "The value of &#34;edit&#34; specifies that the value of the href attribute is the IRI of an editable Member Entry. When appearing within an atom:entry, the href IRI can be used to retrieve, update, and delete the Resource represented by that Entry. An atom:entry MUST NOT contain more than one &#34;edit&#34; link relation."), [`edit-media`](/concepts/link-relation/edit-media "When appearing within an atom:entry, the value of the href attribute is an IRI that can be used to modify a Media Resource associated with that Entry.")

### HTTP Header Fields

[`Slug`](/concepts/http-header/Slug "Slug is an HTTP entity-header whose presence in a POST to a Collection constitutes a request by the client to use the header's value as part of any URIs that would normally be used to retrieve the to-be-created Entry or Media Resources.")
