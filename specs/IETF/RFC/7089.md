title:  "HTTP framework for time-based access to resource states - Memento"
---

| *Document Name:* | RFC 7089
| *Document URI:* | `urn:ietf:rfc:7089`
| *Online Version:* | [`http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089)
| *Organization:* | [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](..  "List of specification series by this organization")
| *Series:* | [Request for Comments (RFC)](.  "List of specifications in this series")
| *Abstract:* | The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web. It facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given resource by introducing datetime negotiation and TimeMaps. Datetime negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime. TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior states of the given resource. The framework also facilitates recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of another resource.

## Specified Web Concepts:

### HTTP Header Fields

[`Accept-Datetime`](/concepts/http-header/Accept-Datetime "The &#34;Accept-Datetime&#34; request header is transmitted by a user agent to indicate it wants to access a past state of an Original Resource. To that end, the &#34;Accept-Datetime&#34; header is conveyed in an HTTP request issued against a TimeGate for an Original Resource, and its value indicates the datetime of the desired past state of the Original Resource."), [`Memento-Datetime`](/concepts/http-header/Memento-Datetime "The &#34;Memento-Datetime&#34; response header is used by a server to indicate that a response reflects a prior state of an Original Resource. Its value expresses the datetime of that state.")

### Link Relations

[`memento`](/concepts/link-relation/memento "A link with a &#34;memento&#34; Relation Type is used to point from a TimeGate or a Memento for an Original Resource, as well as from the Original Resource itself, to a Memento for the Original Resource."), [`original`](/concepts/link-relation/original "A link with an &#34;original&#34; Relation Type is used to point from a TimeGate or a Memento to its associated Original Resource."), [`timegate`](/concepts/link-relation/timegate "A link with a &#34;timegate&#34; Relation Type is used to point from the Original Resource, as well as from a Memento associated with the Original Resource, to a TimeGate for the Original Resource."), [`timemap`](/concepts/link-relation/timemap "A link with a &#34;timemap&#34; Relation Type is used to point from a TimeGate or a Memento associated with an Original Resource, as well as from the Original Resource itself, to a TimeMap for the Original Resource.")
