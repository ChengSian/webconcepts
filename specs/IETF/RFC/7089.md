title:  "HTTP framework for time-based access to resource states - Memento"

| Canonical Name | RFC 7089
| Online Version | [`http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089)

| Abstract | The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web. It facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given resource by introducing datetime negotiation and TimeMaps. Datetime negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime. TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior states of the given resource. The framework also facilitates recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of another resource.
