## Specified Web Concepts:

### Link Relations

[`alternate`](/concepts/link-relation/alternate "The value &#34;alternate&#34; signifies that the IRI in the value of the href attribute identifies an alternate version of the resource described by the containing element."), [`enclosure`](/concepts/link-relation/enclosure "The value &#34;enclosure&#34; signifies that the IRI in the value of the href attribute identifies a related resource that is potentially large in size and might require special handling. For atom:link elements with rel=&#34;enclosure&#34;, the length attribute SHOULD be provided."), [`related`](/concepts/link-relation/related "The value &#34;related&#34; signifies that the IRI in the value of the href attribute identifies a resource related to the resource described by the containing element. For example, the feed for a site that discusses the performance of the search engine at &#34;http://search.example.com&#34; might contain, as a child of atom:feed: <link rel=&#34;related&#34; href=&#34;http://search.example.com/&#34;/> An identical link might appear as a child of any atom:entry whose content contains a discussion of that same search engine."), [`self`](/concepts/link-relation/self "The value &#34;self&#34; signifies that the IRI in the value of the href attribute identifies a resource equivalent to the containing element."), [`via`](/concepts/link-relation/via "The value &#34;via&#34; signifies that the IRI in the value of the href attribute identifies a resource that is the source of the information provided in the containing element.")

### Media Types

[`application/atom+xml`](/concepts/media-type/application/atom+xml "This specification describes two kinds of Atom Documents: Atom Feed Documents and Atom Entry Documents. Both kinds of Atom Documents are specified in terms of the XML Information Set, serialized as XML 1.0 and identified with the &#34;application/atom+xml&#34; media type. Atom Documents MUST be well-formed XML.")
