| *Organization:* | [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](..  "List of specification series by this organization")

| *Abstract:* | OAuth provides a method for clients to access server resources on behalf of a resource owner (such as a different client or an end-user). It also provides a process for end-users to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials (typically, a username and password pair), using user-agent redirections.
