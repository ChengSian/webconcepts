title:  "HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA)"

| *Canonical Name* | RFC 7486
| *Online Version* | [`http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7486`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7486)
| *Organization* | [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](..  "List of specification series by this organization")
| *Series* | [Request for Comments (RFC)](.  "List of specifications in this series")
| *Abstract* | HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is a digital-signature-based design for an HTTP authentication method. The design can also be used in JavaScript-based authentication embedded in HTML. HOBA is an alternative to HTTP authentication schemes that require passwords and therefore avoids all problems related to passwords, such as leakage of server-side password databases.

## Specified Web Concepts:

### HTTP Header Fields

[`Hobareg`](/concepts/http-header/Hobareg "The server MUST add a header field to the response message when the registration has succeeded in order to indicate the new state. The header to be used is &#34;Hobareg&#34;, and the value when registration has succeeded is to be &#34;regok&#34;. When registration is in an intermediate state (e.g., on an HTTP response for an interstitial page), the server MAY add this header with a value of &#34;reginwork&#34;.")

### Well-Known URIs

[`hoba`](/concepts/well-known-uri/hoba "HOBA-http uses a well-known URI &#34;hoba&#34; as a base URI for performing many tasks: &#34;https://www.example.com/.well-known/hoba&#34;. These URIs are based on the name of the host that the HTTP client is accessing.")
