| Canonical Name | RFC 5842
| Online Version | [`http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5842`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5842)
| Organization | [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](..)
| Series | [Request for Comments (RFC)](.)
| Abstract | This specification defines bindings, and the BIND method for creating multiple bindings to the same resource. Creating a new binding to a resource causes at least one new URI to be mapped to that resource. Servers are required to ensure the integrity of any bindings that they allow to be created.

### HTTP Status Codes

[`208`](/concepts/http-status-code/208 "The 208 (Already Reported) status code can be used inside a DAV: propstat response element to avoid enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection repeatedly. For each binding to a collection inside the request's scope, only one will be reported with a 200 status, while subsequent DAV:response elements for all other bindings will use the 208 status, and no DAV:response elements for their descendants are included."), [`508`](/concepts/http-status-code/508 "The 508 (Loop Detected) status code indicates that the server terminated an operation because it encountered an infinite loop while processing a request with &#34;Depth: infinity&#34;. This status indicates that the entire operation failed.")

### HTTP Request Methods

[`BIND`](/concepts/http-method/BIND "The BIND method modifies the collection identified by the Request-URI, by adding a new binding from the segment specified in the BIND body to the resource identified in the BIND body."), [`REBIND`](/concepts/http-method/REBIND "The REBIND method removes a binding to a resource from a collection, and adds a binding to that resource into the collection identified by the Request-URI. The request body specifies the binding to be added (segment) and the old binding to be removed (href). It is effectively an atomic form of a MOVE request, and MUST be treated the same way as MOVE for the purpose of determining access permissions."), [`UNBIND`](/concepts/http-method/UNBIND "The UNBIND method modifies the collection identified by the Request-URI by removing the binding identified by the segment specified in the UNBIND body.")
