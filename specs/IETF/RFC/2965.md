title:  "HTTP State Management Mechanism"

| Canonical Name | RFC 2965
| Online Version | [`http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2965`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2965)
| Organization | [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](..  "List of specification series by this organization")
| Series | [Request for Comments (RFC)](.  "List of specifications in this series")
| Abstract | This document specifies a way to create a stateful session with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests and responses. It describes three new headers, Cookie, Cookie2, and Set-Cookie2, which carry state information between participating origin servers and user agents. The method described here differs from Netscape's Cookie proposal [Netscape], but it can interoperate with HTTP/1.0 user agents that use Netscape's method.

### HTTP Header Fields

[`Cookie2`](/concepts/http-header/Cookie2 "The Cookie2 request header facilitates interoperation between clients and servers that understand different versions of the cookie specification."), [`Set-Cookie2`](/concepts/http-header/Set-Cookie2 "The origin server initiates a session, if it so desires. To do so, it returns an extra response header to the client, Set-Cookie2.")
