| *Document Name:* | RFC 2660
| *Document URI:* | `2660`
| *Online Version:* | [`http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2660`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2660)
| *Organization:* | [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](..  "List of specification series by this organization")
| *Series:* | [Request for Comments (RFC)](.  "List of specifications in this series")
| *Abstract:* | This memo describes a syntax for securing messages sent using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which forms the basis for the World Wide Web. Secure HTTP (S-HTTP) provides independently applicable security services for transaction confidentiality, authenticity/integrity and non-repudiability of origin. The protocol emphasizes maximum flexibility in choice of key management mechanisms, security policies and cryptographic algorithms by supporting option negotiation between parties for each transaction.
