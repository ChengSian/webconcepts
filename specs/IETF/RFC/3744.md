title:  "Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Access Control Protocol"

| Canonical Name | RFC 3744
| Online Version | [`http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3744`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3744)
| Organization | [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](..)
| Series | [Request for Comments (RFC)](.)
| Abstract | This document specifies a set of methods, headers, message bodies, properties, and reports that define Access Control extensions to the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol. This protocol permits a client to read and modify access control lists that instruct a server whether to allow or deny operations upon a resource (such as HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) method invocations) by a given principal. A lightweight representation of principals as Web resources supports integration of a wide range of user management repositories. Search operations allow discovery and manipulation of principals using human names.
