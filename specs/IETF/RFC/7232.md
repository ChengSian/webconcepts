| Canonical Name | RFC 7232
| Online Version | [`http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232)
| Organization | [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](..)
| Series | [Request for Comments (RFC)](.)
| Abstract | The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines HTTP/1.1 conditional requests, including metadata header fields for indicating state changes, request header fields for making preconditions on such state, and rules for constructing the responses to a conditional request when one or more preconditions evaluate to false.
