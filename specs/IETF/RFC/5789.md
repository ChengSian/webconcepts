| *Canonical Name:* | RFC 5789
| *Document URI:* | `urn:ietf:rfc:5789`
| *Online Version:* | [`http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789)
| *Organization:* | [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](..  "List of specification series by this organization")
| *Series:* | [Request for Comments (RFC)](.  "List of specifications in this series")
| *Abstract:* | Several applications extending the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) require a feature to do partial resource modification. The existing HTTP PUT method only allows a complete replacement of a document. This proposal adds a new HTTP method, PATCH, to modify an existing HTTP resource.

## Specified Web Concepts:

### HTTP Header Fields

[`Accept-Patch`](/concepts/http-header/Accept-Patch "This specification introduces a new response header Accept-Patch used to specify the patch document formats accepted by the server. Accept-Patch SHOULD appear in the OPTIONS response for any resource that supports the use of the PATCH method. The presence of the Accept-Patch header in response to any method is an implicit indication that PATCH is allowed on the resource identified by the Request-URI.")

### HTTP Request Methods

[`PATCH`](/concepts/http-method/PATCH "The PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-URI. The set of changes is represented in a format called a &#34;patch document&#34; identified by a media type. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, the server MAY create a new resource, depending on the patch document type (whether it can logically modify a null resource) and permissions, etc.")
