title:  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2"
---

| *Canonical Name:* | RFC 7540
| *Online Version:* | [`http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540)
| *Organization:* | [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](..  "List of specification series by this organization")
| *Series:* | [Request for Comments (RFC)](.  "List of specifications in this series")
| *Abstract:* | This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection. It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients. This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax. HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.

## Specified Web Concepts:

### HTTP Header Fields

[`HTTP2-Settings`](/concepts/http-header/HTTP2-Settings "A request that upgrades from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 MUST include exactly one &#34;HTTP2-Settings&#34; header field. The &#34;HTTP2-Settings&#34; header field is a connection-specific header field that includes parameters that govern the HTTP/2 connection, provided in anticipation of the server accepting the request to upgrade.")

### HTTP Status Codes

[`421`](/concepts/http-status-code/421 "The 421 (Misdirected Request) status code indicates that the request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response. This can be sent by a server that is not configured to produce responses for the combination of scheme and authority that are included in the request URI.")

### HTTP Request Methods

[`PRI`](/concepts/http-method/PRI "This method is never used by an actual client. This method will appear to be used when an HTTP/1.1 server or intermediary attempts to parse an HTTP/2 connection preface.")
