## Specified Web Concepts:

### HTTP Header Fields

[`Authorization`](/concepts/http-header/Authorization "The client is expected to retry the request, passing an Authorization header field line with Digest scheme, which is defined according to the framework above. The values of the opaque and algorithm fields must be those supplied in the WWW-Authenticate response header field for the entity being requested."), [`WWW-Authenticate`](/concepts/http-header/WWW-Authenticate "If a server receives a request for an access-protected object, and an acceptable Authorization header is not sent, the server responds with a &#34;401 Unauthorized&#34; status code, and a WWW-Authenticate header as per the framework defined above.")
