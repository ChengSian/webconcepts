## Specified Web Concepts:

### HTTP Header Fields

[`Authentication-Info`](/concepts/http-header/Authentication-Info "HTTP authentication schemes can use the Authentication-Info response header field to communicate information after the client's authentication credentials have been accepted. This information can include a finalization message from the server (e.g., it can contain the server authentication)."), [`Proxy-Authentication-Info`](/concepts/http-header/Proxy-Authentication-Info "The Proxy-Authentication-Info response header field is equivalent to Authentication-Info, except that it applies to proxy authentication. However, unlike Authentication-Info, the Proxy-Authentication-Info header field applies only to the next outbound client on the response chain. This is because only the client that chose a given proxy is likely to have the credentials necessary for authentication.")
