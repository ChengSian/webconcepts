| *Document Name:* | RFC 7711
| *Document URI:* | `urn:ietf:rfc:7711`
| *Online Version:* | [`http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7711`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7711)
| *Organization:* | [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](..  "List of specification series by this organization")
| *Series:* | [Request for Comments (RFC)](.  "List of specifications in this series")
| *Abstract:* | Experience has shown that it is difficult to deploy proper PKIX certificates for Transport Layer Security (TLS) in multi-tenanted environments. As a result, domains hosted in such environments often deploy applications using certificates that identify the hosting service, not the hosted domain. Such deployments force end users and peer services to accept a certificate with an improper identifier, resulting in degraded security. This document defines methods that make it easier to deploy certificates for proper server identity checking in non-HTTP application protocols. Although these methods were developed for use in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as a Domain Name Association (DNA) prooftype, they might also be usable in other non-HTTP application protocols.

[`posh`](/concepts/well-known-uri/posh "The suffix &#34;posh&#34; is expected to be followed by an additional path component consisting of a service name (say, &#34;spice&#34;) and a file extension of &#34;.json&#34;, resulting in a full path of, for instance, &#34;/.well-known/posh/spice.json&#34;. Registration of service names shall be requested by developers of the relevant application protocols.")
