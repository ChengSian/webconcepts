| *Canonical Name:* | RFC 5174
| *Document URI:* | `urn:ietf:rfc:5174`
| *Online Version:* | [`http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5174`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5174)
| *Organization:* | [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](..  "List of specification series by this organization")
| *Series:* | [Request for Comments (RFC)](.  "List of specifications in this series")
| *Abstract:* | This memo defines URI fragment identifiers for text/plain MIME entities. These fragment identifiers make it possible to refer to parts of a text/plain MIME entity, either identified by character position or range, or by line position or range. Fragment identifiers may also contain information for integrity checks to make them more robust.

### Media Types

[`text/plain`](/concepts/media-type/text/plain "This memo updates the text/plain media type defined in RFC 2046  by defining URI fragment identifiers for text/plain MIME entities. This makes it possible to refer to parts of a text/plain MIME entity. Such parts can be identified by either character position or range, or by line position or range. Integrity checking information can be added to a fragment identifier to make it more robust, enabling applications to detect changes of the entity.")
