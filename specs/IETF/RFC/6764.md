## Specified Web Concepts:

### Well-Known URIs

[`caldav`](/concepts/well-known-uri/caldav "&#34;caldav&#34; and &#34;carddav&#34; &#34;.well-known&#34; URIs point to a resource that the client can use as the initial &#34;context path&#34; for the service they are trying to connect to. The server MUST redirect HTTP requests for that resource to the actual &#34;context path&#34; using one of the available mechanisms provided by HTTP (e.g., using a 301, 303, or 307 response). Clients MUST handle HTTP redirects on the &#34;.well-known&#34; URI. Servers MUST NOT locate the actual CalDAV or CardDAV service endpoint at the &#34;.well-known&#34; URI."), [`carddav`](/concepts/well-known-uri/carddav "&#34;caldav&#34; and &#34;carddav&#34; &#34;.well-known&#34; URIs point to a resource that the client can use as the initial &#34;context path&#34; for the service they are trying to connect to. The server MUST redirect HTTP requests for that resource to the actual &#34;context path&#34; using one of the available mechanisms provided by HTTP (e.g., using a 301, 303, or 307 response). Clients MUST handle HTTP redirects on the &#34;.well-known&#34; URI. Servers MUST NOT locate the actual CalDAV or CardDAV service endpoint at the &#34;.well-known&#34; URI.")
