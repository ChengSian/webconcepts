| Canonical Name | RFC 6265
| Online Version | [`http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265)

| Abstract | This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields. These header fields can be used by HTTP servers to store state (called cookies) at HTTP user agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the mostly stateless HTTP protocol. Although cookies have many historical infelicities that degrade their security and privacy, the Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields are widely used on the Internet.
