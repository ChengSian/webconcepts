### HTTP Header Fields

[`Status-URI`](/concepts/http-header/Status-URI "The Status-URI response header may be used with the 102 (Processing) status code to inform the client as to the status of a method.")

### HTTP Status Codes

[`102`](/concepts/http-status-code/102 "The 102 (Processing) status code is an interim response used to inform the client that the server has accepted the complete request, but has not yet completed it. This status code SHOULD only be sent when the server has a reasonable expectation that the request will take significant time to complete. As guidance, if a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but arbitrary value) to process the server SHOULD return a 102 (Processing) response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed.")
