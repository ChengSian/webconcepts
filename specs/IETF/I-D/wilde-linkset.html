title:       "Link Relation Types for Web Services"
description: "This specification defines a link relation type and media types for working with sets
of links. Using this link relation type and/or the media types is useful when it becomes
necessary to represent links outside the context of a resource they are linking. One
typical example are scenarios in which the number of links to put in an HTTP Link
header field is too big, and thus these links should become a resource of their own."
