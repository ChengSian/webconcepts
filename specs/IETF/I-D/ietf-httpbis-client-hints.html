title:       "HTTP Client Hints"
description: "An increasing diversity of Web-connected devices and software capabilities has created
a need to deliver optimized content for each device. This specification defines a
set of HTTP request header fields, colloquially known as Client Hints, to address
this. They are intended to be used as input to proactive content negotiation; just
as the Accept header allows clients to indicate what formats they prefer, Client Hints
allow clients to indicate a list of device and agent specific preferences."
