| Abstract | The specification for HTTP API Home Documents provides a JSON syntax only. This specification provides an XML syntax for the same data model, so that the concept of Home Documents can be consistently exposed in both JSON- and XML-based HTTP APIs. It also defines the link relation type "home" so that applications can identify links to home documents.
