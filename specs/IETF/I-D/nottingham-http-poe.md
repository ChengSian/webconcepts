### HTTP Header Fields

[`POE`](/concepts/http-header/POE "The POE HTTP header is a request-header field whose field-value indicates the version of POE that a client supports."), [`POE-Links`](/concepts/http-header/POE-Links "The POE-Links HTTP header is an entity-header field whose field-value is a comma-separated list of quoted URI-references (without fragment identifiers) that the origin server asserts to be POE resources. The contents of the POE-Links response header SHOULD correspond to links found in the content of the response body.")
