---

| Canonical Name | Internet Draft hoffman-xml2rfc
| Online Version | [`http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hoffman-xml2rfc`](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hoffman-xml2rfc)
| Organization | [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](..  "List of specification series by this organization")
| Series | [Internet Draft (I-D)](.  "List of specifications in this series")
| Abstract |  This document defines the "XML2RFC" version 3 vocabulary; an XML-based language used for writing RFCs and Internet-Drafts. It is heavily derived from the version 2 vocabulary that is also under discussion. This document obsoletes the v2 grammar described in RFC 2629 and its expected followup, draft-reschke-xml2rfc.
