title:       "Link Relation Types for Web Services"
description: "Many resources provided on the Web are part of sets of resources that are provided
in a context that is managed by one particular service provider. Often, these sets
of resources are referred to as \"Web Services\" or \"Web APIs\". This specification
defines link relations for representing relationships from those resources to ones
that provide documentation or descriptions of the Web services. The difference between
these concepts is that documentation is primarily intended for human consumers, whereas
descriptions are primarily intended for automated consumers. It also defines a link
relation to identify a status resource that is used to represent operational information
about a service's status."
