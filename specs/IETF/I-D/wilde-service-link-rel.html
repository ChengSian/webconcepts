      <td>Many resources provided on the Web are part of sets of resources that are provided
         in a context that is managed by one particular service provider. Often, these sets
         of resources are referred to as "Web Services" or "Web APIs". This specification defines
         link relations for representing relationships from those resources to ones that provide
         documentation or descriptions of the Web services. The difference between these concepts
         is that documentation is primarily intended for human consumers, whereas descriptions
         are primarily intended for automated consumers. It also defines a link relation to
         identify a status resource that is used to represent operational information about
         a service's status.
