| *Abstract:* | An increasing diversity of connected device form factors and software capabilities has created a need to deliver varying, or optimized content for each device. Client Hints can be used as input to proactive content negotiation; just as the Accept header allowed clients to indicate what formats they prefer, Client Hints allow clients to indicate a list of device and agent specific preferences.
