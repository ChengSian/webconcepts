### HTTP Header Fields

[`Sunset`](/concepts/http-header/Sunset "The Sunset HTTP response header field allows a server to communicate the fact that a resource is expected to become unresponsive at a specific point in time. It provides information for clients which they can use to control their usage of the resource. The Sunset header contains a single timestamp which advertises the point in time when the resource is expected to become unresponsive.")
