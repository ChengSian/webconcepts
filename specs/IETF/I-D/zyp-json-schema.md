This link definition SHOULD be a submission link with a non-safe method (like POST)."), [`full`](/concepts/link-relation/full "This indicates that the target of the link is the full representation for the instance object. The object that contains this link possibly may not be the full representation."), [`instances`](/concepts/link-relation/instances "This indicates the target resource that represents collection of instances of a schema."), [`root`](/concepts/link-relation/root "This relation indicates that the target of the link SHOULD be treated as the root or the body of the representation for the purposes of user agent interaction or fragment resolution.
