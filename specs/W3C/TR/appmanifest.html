title:       "Manifest for Web Application"
description: "This specification defines a JSON-based manifest that provides developers with a centralized
place to put metadata associated with a web application. This includes, but is not
limited to, the web application's name, links to icons, as well as the preferred URL
to open when a user launches the web application. The manifest also allows developers
to declare a default orientation for their web application, as well as providing the
ability to set the display mode for the application (e.g., in fullscreen). Additionally,
the manifest allows a developer to \"scope\" a web application to a URL. This restricts
the URLs to which the application can be navigated and provides a means to \"deep
link\" into a web application from other applications. Using this metadata, user agents
can provide developers with means to create user experiences that are more comparable
to that of a native application. In addition, this specification defines the manifest
link type, which provides a declarative means for a document to be associated with
a manifest."
