| Online Version | [`http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt`](http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt)
| Organization | [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](..  "List of specification series by this organization")
| Series | [Technical Report (TR)](.  "List of specifications in this series")
| Abstract | This specification defines the technical mechanisms for expressing a tracking preference via the DNT request header field in HTTP, via an HTML DOM property readable by embedded scripts, and via properties accessible to various user agent plug-in or extension APIs. It also defines mechanisms for sites to signal whether and how they honor this preference, both in the form of a machine-readable tracking status resource at a well-known location and via a "Tk" response header field, and a mechanism for allowing the user to approve exceptions to DNT as desired.

### HTTP Header Fields

[`DNT`](/concepts/http-header/DNT "The DNT header field is defined as the means for expressing a user's tracking preference via HTTP."), [`Tk`](/concepts/http-header/Tk "The Tk response header field is defined as an OPTIONAL means for indicating the tracking status that applied to the corresponding request, and as a REQUIRED means for indicating that a state-changing request has resulted in an interactive change to the tracking status.")
