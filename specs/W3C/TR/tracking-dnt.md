| Canonical Name | W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt
| Organization | [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](..)
| Series | [Technical Report (TR)](..)
| Abstract | This specification defines the technical mechanisms for expressing a tracking preference via the DNT request header field in HTTP, via an HTML DOM property readable by embedded scripts, and via properties accessible to various user agent plug-in or extension APIs. It also defines mechanisms for sites to signal whether and how they honor this preference, both in the form of a machine-readable tracking status resource at a well-known location and via a "Tk" response header field, and a mechanism for allowing the user to approve exceptions to DNT as desired.
