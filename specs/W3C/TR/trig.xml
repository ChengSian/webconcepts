    <documentation source="http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/">The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a general-purpose language for representing information in the Web. This document defines a textual syntax for RDF called TriG that allows an RDF dataset to be completely written in a compact and natural text form, with abbreviations for common usage patterns and datatypes. TriG is an extension of the Turtle [turtle] format.</documentation>

It consists of a sequence of directives, triple statements, graph statements which contain triple-generating statements and optional blank lines. Comments may be given after a # that is not part of another lexical token and continue to the end of the line.</documentation>
