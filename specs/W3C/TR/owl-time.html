title:       "Time Ontology in OWL"
description: "OWL-Time is an OWL-2 DL ontology of temporal concepts, for describing the temporal
properties of resources in the world or described in Web pages. The ontology provides
a vocabulary for expressing facts about topological (ordering) relations among instants
and intervals, together with information about durations, and about temporal position
including date-time information. Time positions and durations may be expressed using
either the conventional (Gregorian) calendar and clock, or using another temporal
reference system such as Unix-time, geologic time, or different calendars."
