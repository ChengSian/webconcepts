## Specified Web Concepts:

### Media Types

[`application/activity+json`](/concepts/media-type/application/activity+json "In the most basic sense, an &#34;activity&#34; is a semantic description of a potential or completed action. In the former case, the activity expresses what can or might be done with a particular object, while in the latter case, it expresses what has already been done. It is the goal of this specification to provide a JSON-based syntax that is sufficient to express metadata about activities in a rich, human-friendly, machine-processable and extensible manner. This may include constructing natural-language descriptions or visual representations about the activity, associating actionable information with various types of objects, communicating or recording activity logs, or delegation of potential actions to other applications.")
