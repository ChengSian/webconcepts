      </th>
      <td> HTTP is used increasingly in applications that need more facilities than the standard
         version of the protocol provides, ranging from distributed authoring, collaboration,
         and printing, to various remote procedure call mechanisms. The Protocol Extension
         Protocol (PEP) is an extension mechanism designed to address the tension between private
         agreement and public specification and to accommodate extension of applications such
         as HTTP clients, servers, and proxies. The PEP mechanism is designed to associate
         each extension with a URI, and use a few new RFC 822 derived header fields to carry
         the extension identifier and related information between the parties involved in an
         extended transaction. This document defines PEP and describes the interactions between
         PEP and HTTP/1.1. PEP is intended to be compatible with HTTP/1.0 inasmuch as HTTP/1.1
         is compatible with HTTP/1.0. It is proposed that the PEP extension mechanism be included
         in future versions of HTTP. The PEP extension mechanism may be applicable to other
         information exchange not mentioned in this document. It is recommended that readers
         get acquainted with section 1.4 for a suggested reading of this specification and
         a list of sections specific for HTTP based applications.
