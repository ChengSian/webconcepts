title:       "WebSub"
description: "An open, simple, web-scale and decentralized pubsub protocol. Anybody can play. As
opposed to more developed (and more complex) pubsub specs like Jabber Publish-Subscribe
this spec's base profile (the barrier-to-entry to speak it) is dead simple. The fancy
bits required for high-volume publishers and subscribers are optional. The base profile
is HTTP-based, as opposed to XMPP (see more on this below). To dramatically simplify
this spec in several places where we had to choose between supporting A or B, we took
it upon ourselves to say \"only A\", rather than making it an implementation decision.
We offer this spec in hopes that it fills a need or at least advances the state of
the discussion in the pubsub space. Polling is extremely wasteful and high latency.
We think a decentralized pubsub layer is a fundamental, missing layer in the Internet
architecture today and its existence, more than just enabling the obvious lower latency
feed readers, would enable many cool applications, most of which we can't even imagine.
But we're looking forward to decentralized social networking."
