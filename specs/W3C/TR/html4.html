      <td>This specification defines the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the publishing language
         of the World Wide Web. This specification defines HTML 4.01, which is a subversion
         of HTML 4. In addition to the text, multimedia, and hyperlink features of the previous
         versions of HTML (HTML 3.2 and HTML 2.0), HTML 4 supports more multimedia options,
         scripting languages, style sheets, better printing facilities, and documents that
         are more accessible to users with disabilities. HTML 4 also takes great strides towards
         the internationalization of documents, with the goal of making the Web truly World
         Wide.
