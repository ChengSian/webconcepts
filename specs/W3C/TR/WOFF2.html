title:       "WOFF File Format 2.0"
description: "Based on experience with WOFF 1.0, which is widely deployed, this specification was
developed to provide improved compression and thus lower use of network bandwidth,
while still allowing fast decompression even on mobile devices. This is achieved by
combining a content-aware preprocessing step and improved entropy coding, compared
to the Flate compression used in WOFF 1.0."
