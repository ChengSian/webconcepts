| *Abstract* | This specification defines the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the publishing language of the World Wide Web. This specification defines HTML 4.01, which is a subversion of HTML 4. In addition to the text, multimedia, and hyperlink features of the previous versions of HTML (HTML 3.2 and HTML 2.0), HTML 4 supports more multimedia options, scripting languages, style sheets, better printing facilities, and documents that are more accessible to users with disabilities. HTML 4 also takes great strides towards the internationalization of documents, with the goal of making the Web truly World Wide.

## Specified Web Concepts:

### Media Types

[`text/html`](/concepts/media-type/text/html "To publish information for global distribution, one needs a universally understood language, a kind of publishing mother tongue that all computers may potentially understand. The publishing language used by the World Wide Web is HTML (from HyperText Markup Language). HTML gives authors the means to publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.; retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button; design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.; and include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.")

### Link Relations

[`alternate`](/concepts/link-relation/alternate "Designates substitute versions for the document in which the link occurs. When used together with the lang attribute, it implies a translated version of the document. When used together with the media attribute, it implies a version designed for a different medium (or media)."), [`appendix`](/concepts/link-relation/appendix "Refers to a document serving as an appendix in a collection of documents."), [`bookmark`](/concepts/link-relation/bookmark "Refers to a bookmark. A bookmark is a link to a key entry point within an extended document. The title attribute may be used, for example, to label the bookmark. Note that several bookmarks may be defined in each document."), [`chapter`](/concepts/link-relation/chapter "Refers to a document serving as a chapter in a collection of documents."), [`contents`](/concepts/link-relation/contents "Refers to a document serving as a table of contents.

User agents may choose to preload the &#34;next&#34; document, to reduce the perceived load time."), [`prev`](/concepts/link-relation/prev "Refers to the previous document in an ordered series of documents. Some user agents also support the synonym &#34;Previous&#34;."), [`section`](/concepts/link-relation/section "Refers to a document serving as a section in a collection of documents."), [`start`](/concepts/link-relation/start "Refers to the first document in a collection of documents. This link type tells search engines which document is considered by the author to be the starting point of the collection."), [`stylesheet`](/concepts/link-relation/stylesheet "Refers to an external style sheet.
