title:       "Portable Network Graphics"
description: "This document describes PNG (Portable Network Graphics), an extensible file format
for the lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images. PNG provides
a patent-free replacement for GIF and can also replace many common uses of TIFF. Indexed-color,
grayscale, and truecolor images are supported, plus an optional alpha channel. Sample
depths range from 1 to 16 bits. PNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications,
such as the World Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a progressive display option.
PNG is robust, providing both full file integrity checking and simple detection of
common transmission errors. Also, PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved
color matching on heterogeneous platforms."
