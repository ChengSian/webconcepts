| *Online Version:* | [`http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts`](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts)
| *Organization:* | [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](..  "List of specification series by this organization")
| *Series:* | [Technical Report (TR)](.  "List of specifications in this series")
| *Abstract:* | The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for representing information in the Web. This document defines an abstract syntax (a data model) which serves to link all RDF-based languages and specifications. The abstract syntax has two key data structures: RDF graphs are sets of subject-predicate-object triples, where the elements may be IRIs, blank nodes, or datatyped literals. They are used to express descriptions of resources. RDF datasets are used to organize collections of RDF graphs, and comprise a default graph and zero or more named graphs. RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax also introduces key concepts and terminology, and discusses datatyping and the handling of fragment identifiers in IRIs within RDF graphs.

## Specified Web Concepts:

### Well-Known URIs

[`genid`](/concepts/well-known-uri/genid "Systems that want Skolem IRIs to be recognizable outside of the system boundaries should use a well-known IRI with the registered name genid. This is an IRI that uses the HTTP or HTTPS scheme, or another scheme that has been specified to use well-known IRIs; and whose path component starts with /.well-known/genid/.")
