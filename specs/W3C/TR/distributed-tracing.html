title:       "Trace Context"
description: "Distributed tracing is a set of tools and practices to monitor the health and reliability
of a distributed application. A distributed application is an application that consists
of multiple components that are deployed and operated separately. It is also known
as micro-service. The main concept behind distributed tracing is event correlation.
Event correlation is a way to correlate events from one component to the events from
another. It allows to find the cause-and-effect relationship between these events.
For instance – find which user action in a browser caused a failure in the business
logic layer. To correlate events between components, these components need to exchange
and store a piece of information called context. Typically context consists of an
originating event identifier, an originating component identity and other event properties.
Context has two parts. The first part is a trace context. Trace context consists of
properties crucial for event correlation. The second part is correlation context.
Correlation context carries user-defined properties. These properties may be helpful
for correlation scenarios. But they are not required and components may choose to
not carry or store them. Unifying the format of distributed tracing context as well
as aligning on semantic meaning of the values is the main objective of this working
group. The goal is to share this with the community so that various tracing and diagnostics
products can operate together."
