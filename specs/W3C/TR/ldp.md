## Specified Web Concepts:

### HTTP Header Fields

[`Accept-Post`](/concepts/http-header/Accept-Post "The Accept-Post HTTP header SHOULD appear in the OPTIONS response for any resource that supports the use of the POST method. The presence of the Accept-Post header in response to any method is an implicit indication that POST is allowed on the resource identified by the Request-URI. The presence of a specific document format in this header indicates that that specific format is allowed on POST requests to the resource identified by the Request-URI.")

### Link Relations

[`describedby`](/concepts/link-relation/describedby "The relationship A describedby B asserts that resource B provides a description of resource A. There are no constraints on the format or representation of either A or B, neither are there any further constraints on either resource.")
