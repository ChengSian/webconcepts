description: "This specification defines the dns-prefetch, preconnect, prefetch, and prerender relationships
of the HTML Link Element (&lt;link&gt;). These primitives enable the developer, and the
server generating or delivering the resources, to assist the user agent in the decision
process of which origins it should connect to, and which resources it should fetch
and preprocess to improve page performance."
