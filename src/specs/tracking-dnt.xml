    <title>Tracking Preference Expression (DNT)</title>
    <documentation source="http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/">This specification defines the technical mechanisms for expressing a tracking preference via the DNT request header field in HTTP, via an HTML DOM property readable by embedded scripts, and via properties accessible to various user agent plug-in or extension APIs. It also defines mechanisms for sites to signal whether and how they honor this preference, both in the form of a machine-readable tracking status resource at a well-known location and via a "Tk" response header field, and a mechanism for allowing the user to approve exceptions to DNT as desired.</documentation>

        <documentation source="http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/#response-header-field">The Tk response header field is defined as an OPTIONAL means for indicating the tracking status that applied to the corresponding request, and as a REQUIRED means for indicating that a state-changing request has resulted in an interactive change to the tracking status.</documentation>
