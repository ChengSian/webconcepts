# SOA/REST Documentation Languages

A very brief overview of existing SOA/REST documentation languages.


## DocBox

[Introduced in March 2016](http://www.mapbox.com/blog/docbox/), [DocBox](https://github.com/mapbox/docbox) is [Mapbox's](http://www.mapbox.com/) Mapbox API documentation system.


## Swagger

What used to be known as [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) has been renamed to [OpenAPI](http://openapis.org/).


## OpenAPI

Previously known as [Swagger](http://swagger.io/), [OpenAPI](http://openapis.org/) now is developed in a more open forum.


## RAML

The [Restful API Modeling Language (RAML)](http://raml.org/) is based on [YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML)](http://yaml.org/).
 

## RESTdesc

[RESTdesc](http://restdesc.org/) has the goal to describe the functionality of hypermedia APIs. It is reusing existing vocabularies on the Semantic Web, and built with today's Semantic Web technologies and tools.
