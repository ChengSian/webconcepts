    <title>Binding Extensions to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)</title>
    <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5842">This specification defines bindings, and the BIND method for creating multiple bindings to the same resource. Creating a new binding to a resource causes at least one new URI to be mapped to that resource. Servers are required to ensure the integrity of any bindings that they allow to be created.</documentation>
    <http-status def="208" desc="Already Reported">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5842#section-7.1">The 208 (Already Reported) status code can be used inside a DAV: propstat response element to avoid enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection repeatedly. For each binding to a collection inside the request's scope, only one will be reported with a 200 status, while subsequent DAV:response elements for all other bindings will use the 208 status, and no DAV:response elements for their descendants are included.</documentation>

    <http-status def="508" desc="Loop Detected">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5842#section-7.1">The 508 (Loop Detected) status code indicates that the server terminated an operation because it encountered an infinite loop while processing a request with "Depth: infinity". This status indicates that the entire operation failed.</documentation>
