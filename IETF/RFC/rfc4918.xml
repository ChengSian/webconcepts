    <title short="WebDAV">HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)</title>
    <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918">Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) consists of a set of methods, headers, and content-types ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management of resource properties, creation and management of resource collections, URL namespace manipulation, and resource locking (collision avoidance).</documentation>
    <http-header def="DAV">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-10.1">This general-header appearing in the response indicates that the resource supports the DAV schema and protocol as specified. As a request header, this header allows the client to advertise compliance with named features when the server needs that information.</documentation>
    </http-header>
    <http-header def="Depth">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-10.2">The Depth request header is used with methods executed on resources that could potentially have internal members to indicate whether the method is to be applied only to the resource ("Depth: 0"), to the resource and its internal members only ("Depth: 1"), or the resource and all its members ("Depth: infinity").</documentation>
    </http-header>
    <http-header def="Destination">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-10.3">The Destination request header specifies the URI that identifies a destination resource for methods such as COPY and MOVE, which take two URIs as parameters.</documentation>
    </http-header>
    <http-header def="If">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-10.4">The If request header is intended to have similar functionality to the If-Match header defined in Section 14.24 of RFC 2616. However, the If header handles any state token as well as ETags. A typical example of a state token is a lock token, and lock tokens are the only state tokens defined in this specification.</documentation>
    </http-header>
    <http-header def="Lock-Token">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-10.5">The Lock-Token request header is used with the UNLOCK method to identify the lock to be removed.</documentation>
    </http-header>
    <http-header def="Overwrite">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-10.6">The Overwrite request header specifies whether the server should overwrite a resource mapped to the destination URL during a COPY or MOVE.</documentation>
    </http-header>
    <http-header def="Timeout">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-10.7">Clients MAY include Timeout request headers in their LOCK requests. However, the server is not required to honor or even consider these requests.</documentation>
    </http-header>
    <http-status def="207" desc="Multi-Status">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-11.1">The 207 (Multi-Status) status code provides status for multiple independent operations.</documentation>
    </http-status>
    <http-status def="422" desc="Unprocessable Entity">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-11.2">The 422 (Unprocessable Entity) status code means the server understands the content type of the request entity (hence a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a 400 (Bad Request) status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained instructions. For example, this error condition may occur if an XML request body contains well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), but semantically erroneous, XML instructions.</documentation>
    </http-status>
    <http-status def="423" desc="Locked">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-11.3">The 423 (Locked) status code means the source or destination resource of a method is locked. This response SHOULD contain an appropriate precondition or postcondition code, such as 'lock-token-submitted' or 'no-conflicting-lock'.</documentation>
    </http-status>
    <http-status def="424" desc="Failed Dependency">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-11.4">The 424 (Failed Dependency) status code means that the method could not be performed on the resource because the requested action depended on another action and that action failed. For example, if a command in a PROPPATCH method fails, then, at minimum, the rest of the commands will also fail with 424 (Failed Dependency).</documentation>
    </http-status>
    <http-status def="507" desc="Insufficient Storage">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-11.5">The 507 (Insufficient Storage) status code means the method could not be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store the representation needed to successfully complete the request. This condition is considered to be temporary. If the request that received this status code was the result of a user action, the request MUST NOT be repeated until it is requested by a separate user action.</documentation>
