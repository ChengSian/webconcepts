The manifest also allows developers to declare a default orientation for their web application, as well as providing the ability to set the display mode for the application (e.g., in fullscreen). Additionally, the manifest allows a developer to ”scope” a web application to a URL. This restricts the URLs to which the application can be navigated and provides a means to ”deep link” into a web application from other applications. Using this metadata, user agents can provide developers with means to create user experiences that are more comparable to that of a native application.
