# Sedola Documentation: Work-in-Progress

Sedola is about documenting services, and some examples (a growing collection, feel free to contribute) are available in the form of [W3C](W3C/) and [IETF](IETF/) (with [RFC](IETF/RFC/) as well as [I-D](IETF/I-D) documents) specifications. From these specification, lists of [HTTP Header Fields](headers.md), [Link Relations](linkrels.md), and [Media Types](mediatypes.md) are generated, and there also is a [list of all specifications](specs.md).

Consider this directory a workspace; whatever is here may change or disappear at an point in time. If you'd like to see how the content is generated, check out the [XSLT](../XSLT/) directory. If there's anything you find interesting but confusing, if there's something you're missing, or if there's something that you think should be fixed, please raise an issue. Thanks!
