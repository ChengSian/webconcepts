# Sedola Documentation: The Web Surface

Sedola is about documenting services, and some examples (a growing collection, feel free to contribute) are available in the form of [W3C](W3C/) and [IETF](IETF/) (with [RFC](IETF/RFC/) as well as [I-D](IETF/I-D) documents) specifications. From these specification, lists of

* [HTTP Cache Directives (14 entries)](cachedirs.md),
* [HTTP Header Fields (170 entries)](headers.md),
* [HTTP Request Methods (37 entries)](methods.md),
* [HTTP Status Codes (61 entries)](statuscodes.md),
* [Link Relations (82 entries)](linkrels.md), and
* [Media Types (34 entries)](mediatypes.md)

are generated, and there also is a [list of all specifications](specs.md).

Consider this directory a workspace; whatever is here may change or disappear at any point in time. If you'd like to see how the content is generated, check out the [XSLT](../XSLT/) directory. If there's anything you find interesting but confusing, if there's something you're missing, or if there's something that you think should be fixed, please raise an issue. Thanks!
