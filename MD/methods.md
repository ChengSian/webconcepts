HTTP Request Method | Description | Specification
-------: | :---------- | :---
`ACL` | "[The ACL method modifies the access control list (which can be read via the DAV:acl property) of a resource. Specifically, the ACL method only permits modification to ACEs that are not inherited, and are not protected.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3744#section-8.1)" | [**RFC 3744**: Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Access Control Protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3744 "This document specifies a set of methods, headers, message bodies, properties, and reports that define Access Control extensions to the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol. This protocol permits a client to read and modify access control lists that instruct a server whether to allow or deny operations upon a resource (such as HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) method invocations) by a given principal. A lightweight representation of principals as Web resources supports integration of a wide range of user management repositories. Search operations allow discovery and manipulation of principals using human names." )
`BASELINE-CONTROL` | "[A collection can be placed under baseline control with a BASELINE-CONTROL request. When a collection is placed under baseline control, the DAV:version-controlled-configuration property of the collection is set to identify a new version-controlled configuration. This version-controlled configuration can be checked out and then checked in to create a new baseline for that collection.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253#section-12.6)" | [**RFC 3253**: Versioning Extensions to WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253 "This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and resource types that define the WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol. WebDAV versioning will minimize the complexity of clients that are capable of interoperating with a variety of versioning repository managers, to facilitate widespread deployment of applications capable of utilizing the WebDAV Versioning services. WebDAV versioning includes automatic versioning for versioning-unaware clients, version history management, workspace management, baseline management, activity management, and URL namespace versioning." )
`BIND` | "[The BIND method modifies the collection identified by the Request-URI, by adding a new binding from the segment specified in the BIND body to the resource identified in the BIND body.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5842#section-4)" | [**RFC 5842**: Binding Extensions to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5842 "This specification defines bindings, and the BIND method for creating multiple bindings to the same resource. Creating a new binding to a resource causes at least one new URI to be mapped to that resource. Servers are required to ensure the integrity of any bindings that they allow to be created." )
`CHECKIN` | "[A CHECKIN request can be applied to a checked-out version-controlled resource to produce a new version whose content and dead properties are copied from the checked-out resource.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253#section-4.4)" | [**RFC 3253**: Versioning Extensions to WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253 "This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and resource types that define the WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol.

WebDAV versioning includes automatic versioning for versioning-unaware clients, version history management, workspace management, baseline management, activity management, and URL namespace versioning." )
`LABEL` | "[A LABEL request can be applied to a version to modify the labels that select that version. The case of a label name MUST be preserved when it is stored and retrieved. When comparing two label names to decide if they match or not, a server SHOULD use a case-sensitive URL-escaped UTF-8 encoded comparison of the two label names.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253#section-8.2)" | [**RFC 3253**: Versioning Extensions to WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253 "This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and resource types that define the WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol.

WebDAV versioning includes automatic versioning for versioning-unaware clients, version history management, workspace management, baseline management, activity management, and URL namespace versioning." )
`MERGE` | "[The MERGE method performs the logical merge of a specified version (the "merge source") into a specified version-controlled resource (the "merge target"). If the merge source is neither an ancestor nor a descendant of the DAV:checked-in or DAV:checked-out version of the merge target, the MERGE checks out the merge target (if it is not already checked out) and adds the URL of the merge source to the DAV:merge-set of the merge target.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253#section-11.2)" | [**RFC 3253**: Versioning Extensions to WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253 "This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and resource types that define the WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol.

WebDAV versioning includes automatic versioning for versioning-unaware clients, version history management, workspace management, baseline management, activity management, and URL namespace versioning." )
`MKACTIVITY` | "[A MKACTIVITY request creates a new activity resource. A server MAY restrict activity creation to particular collections, but a client can determine the location of these collections from a DAV:activity-collection-set OPTIONS request.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253#section-13.5)" | [**RFC 3253**: Versioning Extensions to WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253 "This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and resource types that define the WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol.

WebDAV versioning includes automatic versioning for versioning-unaware clients, version history management, workspace management, baseline management, activity management, and URL namespace versioning." )
`PATCH` | "[The PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-URI. The set of changes is represented in a format called a "patch document" identified by a media type. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, the server MAY create a new resource, depending on the patch document type (whether it can logically modify a null resource) and permissions, etc.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789#section-2)" | [**RFC 5789**: PATCH Method for HTTP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789 "Several applications extending the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) require a feature to do partial resource modification. The existing HTTP PUT method only allows a complete replacement of a document. This proposal adds a new HTTP method, PATCH, to modify an existing HTTP resource." )
`PRI` | "[This method is never used by an actual client. This method will appear to be used when an HTTP/1.1 server or intermediary attempts to parse an HTTP/2 connection preface.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-3.5)" | [**RFC 7540**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540 "This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection. It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients. This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax. HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged." )
`REBIND` | "[The REBIND method removes a binding to a resource from a collection, and adds a binding to that resource into the collection identified by the Request-URI. The request body specifies the binding to be added (segment) and the old binding to be removed (href). It is effectively an atomic form of a MOVE request, and MUST be treated the same way as MOVE for the purpose of determining access permissions.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5842#section-6)" | [**RFC 5842**: Binding Extensions to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5842 "This specification defines bindings, and the BIND method for creating multiple bindings to the same resource. Creating a new binding to a resource causes at least one new URI to be mapped to that resource. Servers are required to ensure the integrity of any bindings that they allow to be created." )
`REPORT` | "[A REPORT request is an extensible mechanism for obtaining information about a resource. Unlike a resource property, which has a single value, the value of a report can depend on additional information specified in the REPORT request body and in the REPORT request headers.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253#section-3.6)" | [**RFC 3253**: Versioning Extensions to WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253 "This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and resource types that define the WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol.
