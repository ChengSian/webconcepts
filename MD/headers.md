Header Field | Description | Specification
-------: | :---------- | :---
`A-IM` | "[The A-IM request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the instance-manipulations that are acceptable in the response. A response may be the result of applying multiple instance-manipulations. When an A-IM request-header field includes one or more delta-coding values, the request MUST contain an If-None-Match header field, listing one or more entity tags from prior responses for the request-URI.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3229#section-10.5.3)" | [RFC 3229](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3229 "Delta encoding in HTTP" )

`Content-Encoding` | "[The "Content-Encoding" header field indicates what content codings have been applied to the representation, beyond those inherent in the media type, and thus what decoding mechanisms have to be applied in order to obtain data in the media type referenced by the Content-Type header field. Content-Encoding is primarily used to allow a representation's data to be compressed without losing the identity of its underlying media type.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.2.2)" | [RFC 7231](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231 "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content" )

`Content-Length` | "[When a message does not have a Transfer-Encoding header field, a Content-Length header field can provide the anticipated size, as a decimal number of octets, for a potential payload body. For messages that do include a payload body, the Content-Length field-value provides the framing information necessary for determining where the body (and message) ends. For messages that do not include a payload body, the Content-Length indicates the size of the selected representation (Section 3 of [Part2]).](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2)" | [RFC 7230](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230 "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing" )

`Content-Type` | "[The "Content-Type" header field indicates the media type of the associated representation: either the representation enclosed in the message payload or the selected representation, as determined by the message semantics. The indicated media type defines both the data format and how that data is intended to be processed by a recipient, within the scope of the received message semantics, after any content codings indicated by Content-Encoding are decoded.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.1.5)" | [RFC 7231](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231 "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content" )

`DASL` | "[The DASL response header indicates server support for query grammars in the OPTIONS method.  The value is a list of URIs that indicate the types of supported grammars.  Note that although the URIs can be used to identify each supported search grammar, there is not necessarily a direct relationship between the URI and the XML element name that can be used in XML based SEARCH requests (the element name itself is identified by its namespace name (a URI reference) and the element's local name).](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5323#section-9.1.1)" | [RFC 5323](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5323 "Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) SEARCH" )

`Delta-Base` | "[The Delta-Base entity-header field is used in a delta-encoded response to specify the entity tag of the base instance. A Delta-Base header field MUST be included in a response with an IM header that includes a delta-coding, if the request included more than one entity tag in its If-None-Match header field. Any response with an IM header that includes a delta-coding MAY include a Delta-Base header.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3229#section-10.5.1)" | [RFC 3229](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3229 "Delta encoding in HTTP" )
`Depth` | "[The Depth request header is used with methods executed on resources that could potentially have internal members to indicate whether the method is to be applied only to the resource ("Depth: 0"), to the resource and its internal members only ("Depth: 1"), or the resource and all its members ("Depth: infinity").](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-10.2)" | [RFC 4918](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918 "HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)" )

`ETag` | "[The "ETag" header field in a response provides the current entity-tag for the selected representation, as determined at the conclusion of handling the request. An entity-tag is an opaque validator for differentiating between multiple representations of the same resource, regardless of whether those multiple representations are due to resource state changes over time, content negotiation resulting in multiple representations being valid at the same time, or both.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-2.3)" | [RFC 7232](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232 "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests" )

`If` | "[The If request header is intended to have similar functionality to the If-Match header defined in Section 14.24 of RFC 2616. However, the If header handles any state token as well as ETags. A typical example of a state token is a lock token, and lock tokens are the only state tokens defined in this specification.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-10.4)" | [RFC 4918](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918 "HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)" )
`If-Match` | "[The "If-Match" header field makes the request method conditional on the recipient origin server either having at least one current representation of the target resource, when the field-value is "*", or having a current representation of the target resource that has an entity-tag matching a member of the list of entity-tags provided in the field-value.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-3.1)" | [RFC 7232](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232 "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests" )
`If-Modified-Since` | "[The "If-Modified-Since" header field makes a GET or HEAD request method conditional on the selected representation's modification date being more recent than the date provided in the field-value.

`If-None-Match` | "[The "If-None-Match" header field makes the request method conditional on a recipient cache or origin server either not having any current representation of the target resource, when the field-value is "*", or having a selected representation with an entity-tag that does not match any of those listed in the field-value.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-3.2)" | [RFC 7232](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232 "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests" )
`If-Range` | "[If a client has a partial copy of a representation and wishes to have an up-to-date copy of the entire representation, it could use the Range header field with a conditional GET (using either or both of If-Unmodified-Since and If-Match.)  However, if the precondition fails because the representation has been modified, the client would then have to make a second request to obtain the entire current representation. The "If-Range" header field allows a client to "short-circuit" the second request. Informally, its meaning is: if the representation is unchanged, send me the part(s) that I am requesting in Range; otherwise, send me the entire representation.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233#section-3.2)" | [RFC 7233](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233 "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Range Requests" )
`If-Unmodified-Since` | "[The "If-Unmodified-Since" header field makes the request method conditional on the selected representation's last modification date being earlier than or equal to the date provided in the field-value. This field accomplishes the same purpose as If-Match for cases where the user agent does not have an entity-tag for the representation.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-3.4)" | [RFC 7232](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232 "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests" )
`Key` | "[The "Key" response header field describes the request attributes that the server has used to select the current representation. As such, its semantics are similar to the "Vary" response header field, but it allows more fine-grained description, using "key modifiers". Caches can use this information as part of determining whether a stored response can be used to satisfy a given request. When a cache fully implements this mechanism, it MAY ignore the Vary response header field. Additionally, user agents can use this information to discover if additional request header fields might influence the resulting response.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fielding-http-key#section-2)" | [draft-fielding-http-key](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fielding-http-key "The Key HTTP Response Header Field" )
