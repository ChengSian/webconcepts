HTTP Header Field | Description | Specification
-------: | :---------- | :---
`A-IM` | "[The A-IM request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the instance-manipulations that are acceptable in the response. A response may be the result of applying multiple instance-manipulations. When an A-IM request-header field includes one or more delta-coding values, the request MUST contain an If-None-Match header field, listing one or more entity tags from prior responses for the request-URI.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3229#section-10.5.3)" | [**RFC 3229**: Delta encoding in HTTP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3229 "This document describes how delta encoding can be supported as a compatible extension to HTTP/1.1. Many HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) requests cause the retrieval of slightly modified instances of resources for which the client already has a cache entry. Research has shown that such modifying updates are frequent, and that the modifications are typically much smaller than the actual entity. In such cases, HTTP would make more efficient use of network bandwidth if it could transfer a minimal description of the changes, rather than the entire new instance of the resource. This is called ”delta encoding.”" )
`ALPN` | "[Clients include the ALPN header field in an HTTP CONNECT request to indicate the application-layer protocol that a client intends to use within the tunnel, or a set of protocols that might be used within the tunnel.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7639#section-2)" | [**RFC 7639**: The ALPN HTTP Header Field](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7639 "This specification allows HTTP CONNECT requests to indicate what protocol is intended to be used within the tunnel once established, using the ALPN header field." )
`Accept` | "[The "Accept" header field can be used by user agents to specify response media types that are acceptable. Accept header fields can be used to indicate that the request is specifically limited to a small set of desired types, as in the case of a request for an in-line image.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.2)" | [**RFC 7231**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

`Accept-Additions`<sub>(2 definitions)</sub> | "[In HTTP, the "Accept" request-header field is used to specify media types which are acceptable for the response. However, in HTCPCP, the response may result in additional actions on the part of the automated pot. For this reason, HTCPCP adds a new header field, "Accept-Additions".](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2324#section-2.2.2.1)" | [**RFC 2324**: Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP/1.0)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2324 "This document describes HTCPCP, a protocol for controlling, monitoring, and diagnosing coffee pots." )
`Accept-Additions`<sub>(2 definitions)</sub> | "[It has been observed that some users of blended teas have an occasional preference for teas brewed as an emulsion of cane sugar with hints of water.

This paper outlines an extension to HTCPCP to allow for pots to provide networked tea-brewing facilities." )
`Accept-Charset` | "[The "Accept-Charset" header field can be sent by a user agent to indicate what charsets are acceptable in textual response content. This field allows user agents capable of understanding more comprehensive or special-purpose charsets to signal that capability to an origin server that is capable of representing information in those charsets.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.3)" | [**RFC 7231**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

`Accept-Datetime` | "[The "Accept-Datetime" request header is transmitted by a user agent to indicate it wants to access a past state of an Original Resource. To that end, the "Accept-Datetime" header is conveyed in an HTTP request issued against a TimeGate for an Original Resource, and its value indicates the datetime of the desired past state of the Original Resource.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089#section-2.1.1)" | [**RFC 7089**: HTTP framework for time-based access to resource states - Memento](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089 "The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web. It facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given resource by introducing datetime negotiation and TimeMaps. Datetime negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime. TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior states of the given resource. The framework also facilitates recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of another resource." )
`Accept-Encoding`<sub>(2 definitions)</sub> | "[The "Accept-Encoding" header field can be used by user agents to indicate what response content-codings are acceptable in the response. An "identity" token is used as a synonym for "no encoding" in order to communicate when no encoding is preferred.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.4)" | [**RFC 7231**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

`Accept-Encoding`<sub>(2 definitions)</sub> | "[Section 5.3.4 of RFC 7231 defines "Accept-Encoding" as a request header field only. This specification expands that definition to allow "Accept-Encoding" as a response header field as well. When present in a response, it indicates what content codings the resource was willing to accept in the associated request. A field value that only contains "identity" implies that no content codings were supported.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7694#section-3)" | [**RFC 7694**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Client-Initiated Content-Encoding](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7694 "In HTTP, content codings allow for payload encodings such as for compression or integrity checks. In particular, the ”gzip” content coding is widely used for payload data sent in response messages. Content codings can be used in request messages as well, however discoverability is not on par with response messages. This document extends the HTTP ”Accept-Encoding” header field for use in responses, to indicate that content codings are supported in requests." )
`Accept-Features` | "[The Accept-Features request header can be used by a user agent to give information about the presence or absence of certain features in the feature set of the current request. Servers can use this information when running a remote variant selection algorithm.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2295#section-8.2)" | [**RFC 2295**: Transparent Content Negotiation in HTTP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2295 "HTTP allows web site authors to put multiple versions of the same information under a single URL.

This enables the smooth deployment of new web data formats and markup tags." )
`Accept-Indefinite-Ranges` | "[The Accept-Indefinite-Ranges request-header field allows the client to indicate its acceptance of indefinite-sized range requests for a resource.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-combs-http-indeterminate-range#section-2.1)" | [**draft-combs-http-indeterminate-range**: HTTP/1.1: Range Responses of Indeterminate Length](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-combs-http-indeterminate-range "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP has been in use by the World Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This document updates RFC 7233 Part 5 of the eight-part specification that defines the protocol referred to as ”HTTP/1.1”. Part 5 defines range-specific requests and the rules for constructing and combining responses to those requests. This document improves support for responding to range requests for resources of indeterminate size." )
`Accept-Language` | "[The "Accept-Language" header field can be used by user agents to indicate the set of natural languages that are preferred in the response.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.5)" | [**RFC 7231**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

`Accept-Patch` | "[This specification introduces a new response header Accept-Patch used to specify the patch document formats accepted by the server. Accept-Patch SHOULD appear in the OPTIONS response for any resource that supports the use of the PATCH method.

`Accept-Post` | "[The Accept-Post HTTP header SHOULD appear in the OPTIONS response for any resource that supports the use of the POST method. The presence of the Accept-Post header in response to any method is an implicit indication that POST is allowed on the resource identified by the Request-URI. The presence of a specific document format in this header indicates that that specific format is allowed on POST requests to the resource identified by the Request-URI.](http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#header-accept-post)" | [**W3C TR ldp**: Linked Data Platform 1.0 (LDP)](http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/ "Linked Data Platform (LDP) defines a set of rules for HTTP operations on web resources, some based on RDF, to provide an architecture for read-write Linked Data on the web." )
`Accept-Push-Policy` | "[A client can express the desired push policy for a request by sending an "Accept-Push-Policy" header field in the request.

This document defines PEP and describes the interactions between PEP and HTTP/1.1. PEP is intended to be compatible with HTTP/1.0 inasmuch as HTTP/1.1 is compatible with HTTP/1.0. It is proposed that the PEP extension mechanism be included in future versions of HTTP. The PEP extension mechanism may be applicable to other information exchange not mentioned in this document. It is recommended that readers get acquainted with section 1.4 for a suggested reading of this specification and a list of sections specific for HTTP based applications." )

The PEP mechanism is designed to associate each extension with a URI, and use a few new RFC 822 derived header fields to carry the extension identifier and related information between the parties involved in an extended transaction. This document defines PEP and describes the interactions between PEP and HTTP/1.1. PEP is intended to be compatible with HTTP/1.0 inasmuch as HTTP/1.1 is compatible with HTTP/1.0. It is proposed that the PEP extension mechanism be included in future versions of HTTP. The PEP extension mechanism may be applicable to other information exchange not mentioned in this document. It is recommended that readers get acquainted with section 1.4 for a suggested reading of this specification and a list of sections specific for HTTP based applications." )

`URI` | "[The URI header field has, in past versions of this specification, been used as a combination of the existing Location, Content-Location, and Vary header fields as well as the future Alternates field. Its primary purpose has been to include a list of additional URIs for the resource, including names and mirror locations. However, it has become clear that the combination of many different functions within this single field has been a barrier to consistently and correctly implementing any of those functions. Furthermore, we believe that the identification of names and mirror locations would be better performed via the Link header field.
