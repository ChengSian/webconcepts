`Sec-WebSocket-Version` | [**RFC 6455**](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455 "The WebSocket Protocol" ): [The Sec-WebSocket-Version header field is used in the WebSocket opening handshake. It is sent from the client to the server to indicate the protocol version of the connection. This enables servers to correctly interpret the opening handshake and subsequent data being sent from the data, and close the connection if the server cannot interpret that data in a safe manner. The Sec-WebSocket-Version header field is also sent from the server to the client on WebSocket handshake error, when the version received from the client does not match a version understood by the server. In such a case, the header field includes the protocol version(s) supported by the server.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-11.3.5)
`Security-Scheme` | [**RFC 2660**](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2660 "The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol (S-HTTP)" ): [All S-HTTP compliant agents must generate the Security-Scheme header in the headers of all HTTP messages they generate.

`Signature` | [**draft-cavage-http-signatures**](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures "Signing HTTP Messages" ): [The "signature" HTTP Header is based on the model that the sender must authenticate itself with a digital signature produced by either a private asymmetric key (e.g., RSA) or a shared symmetric key (e.g., HMAC). The scheme is parameterized enough such that it is not bound to any particular key type or signing algorithm. However, it does explicitly assume that senders can send an HTTP 'Date' header.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures#section-4)

`URI` | [**RFC 2068**](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068 "Hypertext Transfer Protocol - HTTP/1.1" ): [The URI header field has, in past versions of this specification, been used as a combination of the existing Location, Content-Location, and Vary header fields as well as the future Alternates field. Its primary purpose has been to include a list of additional URIs for the resource, including names and mirror locations. However, it has become clear that the combination of many different functions within this single field has been a barrier to consistently and correctly implementing any of those functions. Furthermore, we believe that the identification of names and mirror locations would be better performed via the Link header field. The URI header field is therefore deprecated in favor of those other fields.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068#section-19.6.2.5)
