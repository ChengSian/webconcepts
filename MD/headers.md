HTTP Header Fields
==============

The following HTTP header field definitions were found in 25 services (5 [W3C](../W3C/), 13 [RFC](../IETF/RFC/), 7 [I-D](../IETF/I-D)):

* [Accept-Patch](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789#section-3.1 "This specification introduces a new response header Accept-Patch used to specify the patch document formats accepted by the server. Accept-Patch SHOULD appear in the OPTIONS response for any resource that supports the use of the PATCH method. The presence of the Accept-Patch header in response to any method is an implicit indication that PATCH is allowed on the resource identified by the Request-URI." ) : [PATCH Method for HTTP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789 "Several applications extending the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) require a feature to do partial resource modification. The existing HTTP PUT method only allows a complete replacement of a document. This proposal adds a new HTTP method, PATCH, to modify an existing HTTP resource." )
* [Accept-Post](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-accept-post-01#section-3 "Accept-Post SHOULD appear in the OPTIONS response for any resource that supports the use of the POST method. The presence of the Accept-Post header in response to any method is an implicit indication that POST is allowed on the resource identified by the Request-URI. The presence of a specific document format in this header indicates that that specific format is allowed on the resource identified by the Request-URI." ) : [The Accept-Post HTTP Header](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-accept-post "This specification defines a new HTTP response header field Accept-Post, which indicates server support for specific media types for entity bodies in HTTP POST requests." )
* [Access-Control-Allow-Credentials](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-allow-credentials-response-header "The Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header indicates whether the response to request can be exposed when the omit credentials flag is unset. When part of the response to a preflight request it indicates that the actual request can include user credentials." ) : [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/ "This document defines a mechanism to enable client-side cross-origin requests. Specifications that enable an API to make cross-origin requests to resources can use the algorithms defined by this specification. If such an API is used on http://example.org resources, a resource on http://hello-world.example can opt in using the mechanism described by this specification (e.g., specifying Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.org as response header), which would allow that resource to be fetched cross-origin from http://example.org." )

* [Access-Control-Max-Age](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-max-age-response-header "The Access-Control-Max-Age header indicates how long the results of a preflight request can be cached in a preflight result cache." ) : [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/ "This document defines a mechanism to enable client-side cross-origin requests.
