Header Field | Description | Specification
-------: | :---------- | :---
`Accept` | "[The "Accept" header field can be used by user agents to specify response media types that are acceptable. Accept header fields can be used to indicate that the request is specifically limited to a small set of desired types, as in the case of a request for an in-line image.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics#section-5.3.2)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines the semantics of HTTP/1.1 messages as expressed by request methods, request header fields, response status codes, and response header fields, along with the payload of messages (metadata and body content) and mechanisms for content negotiation." )
`Accept-Charset` | "[The "Accept-Charset" header field can be sent by a user agent to indicate what charsets are acceptable in textual response content. This field allows user agents capable of understanding more comprehensive or special-purpose charsets to signal that capability to an origin server that is capable of representing information in those charsets.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics#section-5.3.3)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines the semantics of HTTP/1.1 messages as expressed by request methods, request header fields, response status codes, and response header fields, along with the payload of messages (metadata and body content) and mechanisms for content negotiation." )
`Accept-Datetime` | "[The "Accept-Datetime" request header is transmitted by a user agent to indicate it wants to access a past state of an Original Resource. To that end, the "Accept-Datetime" header is conveyed in an HTTP request issued against a TimeGate for an Original Resource, and its value indicates the datetime of the desired past state of the Original Resource.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-vandesompel-memento#section-2.1.1)" | [HTTP framework for time-based access to resource states - Memento](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-vandesompel-memento "The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web. It facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given resource by introducing datetime negotiation and TimeMaps. Datetime negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime. TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior states of the given resource. The framework also facilitates recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of another resource." )
`Accept-Encoding` | "[The "Accept-Encoding" header field can be used by user agents to indicate what response content-codings are acceptable in the response. An "identity" token is used as a synonym for "no encoding" in order to communicate when no encoding is preferred.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics#section-5.3.4)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

`Accept-Patch` | "[This specification introduces a new response header Accept-Patch used to specify the patch document formats accepted by the server. Accept-Patch SHOULD appear in the OPTIONS response for any resource that supports the use of the PATCH method. The presence of the Accept-Patch header in response to any method is an implicit indication that PATCH is allowed on the resource identified by the Request-URI.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789#section-3.1)" | [PATCH Method for HTTP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789 "Several applications extending the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) require a feature to do partial resource modification. The existing HTTP PUT method only allows a complete replacement of a document. This proposal adds a new HTTP method, PATCH, to modify an existing HTTP resource." )
`Accept-Post` | "[Accept-Post SHOULD appear in the OPTIONS response for any resource that supports the use of the POST method. The presence of the Accept-Post header in response to any method is an implicit indication that POST is allowed on the resource identified by the Request-URI.

Some optional elements specified by RFC 2069 have been removed from this specification due to problems found since its publication; other new elements have been added for compatibility, those new elements have been made optional, but are strongly recommended. Like Basic, Digest access authentication verifies that both parties to a communication know a shared secret (a password); unlike Basic, this verification can be done without sending the password in the clear, which is Basic's biggest weakness. As with most other authentication protocols, the greatest sources of risks are usually found not in the core protocol itself but in policies and procedures surrounding its use." )

Client Hints can be used as input to proactive content negotiation; just as the Accept header allowed clients to indicate what formats they prefer, Client Hints allow clients to indicate a list of device and agent specific preferences." )
`Cache-Control` | "[The "Cache-Control" header field is used to specify directives for caches along the request/response chain. Such cache directives are unidirectional in that the presence of a directive in a request does not imply that the same directive is to be given in the response.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p6-cache#section-5.2)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p6-cache "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

`Content-Disposition` | "[The Content-Disposition response header field is used to convey additional information about how to process the response payload, and also can be used to attach additional metadata, such as the filename to use when saving the response payload locally.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6266#section-4)" | [Use of the Content-Disposition Header Field in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6266 "RFC 2616 defines the Content-Disposition response header field, but points out that it is not part of the HTTP/1.1 Standard. This specification takes over the definition and registration of Content-Disposition, as used in HTTP, and clarifies internationalization aspects." )
`Content-Encoding` | "[The "Content-Encoding" header field indicates what content codings have been applied to the representation, beyond those inherent in the media type, and thus what decoding mechanisms have to be applied in order to obtain data in the media type referenced by the Content-Type header field.

`Content-Language` | "[The "Content-Location" header field references a URI that can be used as an identifier for a specific resource corresponding to the representation in this message's payload. In other words, if one were to perform a GET request on this URI at the time of this message's generation, then a 200 (OK) response would contain the same representation that is enclosed as payload in this message.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics#section-3.1.4.2)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

`Content-Length` | "[When a message does not have a Transfer-Encoding header field, a Content-Length header field can provide the anticipated size, as a decimal number of octets, for a potential payload body. For messages that do include a payload body, the Content-Length field-value provides the framing information necessary for determining where the body (and message) ends. For messages that do not include a payload body, the Content-Length indicates the size of the selected representation (Section 3 of [Part2]).](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging#section-3.3.2)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

`Content-Range` | "[The "Content-Range" header field is sent in a single part 206 (Partial Content) response to indicate the partial range of the selected representation enclosed as the message payload, sent in each part of a multipart 206 response to indicate the range enclosed within each body part, and sent in 416 (Range Not Satisfiable) responses to provide information about the selected representation.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p5-range#section-4.2)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Range Requests](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p5-range "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines range requests and the rules for constructing and combining responses to those requests." )
`Content-Type` | "[The "Content-Type" header field indicates the media type of the associated representation: either the representation enclosed in the message payload or the selected representation, as determined by the message semantics.

`Cookie` | "[The user agent sends stored cookies to the origin server in the Cookie header.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-4.2)" | [HTTP State Management Mechanism](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265 "This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields. These header fields can be used by HTTP servers to store state (called cookies) at HTTP user agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the mostly stateless HTTP protocol.

This scheme is not considered to be a secure method of user authentication (unless used in conjunction with some external secure system such as SSL), as the user name and password are passed over the network as cleartext. This document also provides the specification for HTTP's authentication framework, the original Basic authentication scheme and a scheme based on cryptographic hashes, referred to as ”Digest Access Authentication”. It is therefore also intended to serve as a replacement for RFC 2069. Some optional elements specified by RFC 2069 have been removed from this specification due to problems found since its publication; other new elements have been added for compatibility, those new elements have been made optional, but are strongly recommended. Like Basic, Digest access authentication verifies that both parties to a communication know a shared secret (a password); unlike Basic, this verification can be done without sending the password in the clear, which is Basic's biggest weakness. As with most other authentication protocols, the greatest sources of risks are usually found not in the core protocol itself but in policies and procedures surrounding its use." )
`WWW-Authenticate` | "[The "WWW-Authenticate" header field consists of at least one challenge that indicates the authentication scheme(s) and parameters applicable to the effective request URI.

However, this is specifically defined to cover the body of the actual message, not the contents of the full file (which might be quite different, if the response is a Content-Range, or uses a delta encoding).  Also, the Content-MD5 is limited to one specific digest algorithm; other algorithms, such as SHA-1 (Secure Hash Standard), may be more appropriate in some circumstances.  Finally, HTTP/1.1 provides no explicit mechanism by which a client may request a digest.  This document proposes HTTP extensions that solve these problems." )
