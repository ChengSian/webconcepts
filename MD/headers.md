==============

The following HTTP header field definitions were found in 32 services (6 [W3C](../W3C/), 19 [RFC](../IETF/RFC/), 7 [I-D](../IETF/I-D)):

Header Field | Description | Specification
-------: | :---------- | :---
`Accept-Patch` | "[This specification introduces a new response header Accept-Patch used to specify the patch document formats accepted by the server. Accept-Patch SHOULD appear in the OPTIONS response for any resource that supports the use of the PATCH method. The presence of the Accept-Patch header in response to any method is an implicit indication that PATCH is allowed on the resource identified by the Request-URI.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789#section-3.1)" | [PATCH Method for HTTP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789 "Several applications extending the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) require a feature to do partial resource modification. The existing HTTP PUT method only allows a complete replacement of a document. This proposal adds a new HTTP method, PATCH, to modify an existing HTTP resource." )
`Accept-Post` | "[Accept-Post SHOULD appear in the OPTIONS response for any resource that supports the use of the POST method. The presence of the Accept-Post header in response to any method is an implicit indication that POST is allowed on the resource identified by the Request-URI.
