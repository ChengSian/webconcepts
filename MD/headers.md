HTTP Header Fields
==============

The following 22 HTTP header field definitions were found in 37 services (6 [W3C](../W3C/), 22 [RFC](../IETF/RFC/), 9 [I-D](../IETF/I-D)):

Header Field | Description | Specification
-------: | :---------- | :---
`Accept-Patch` | "[This specification introduces a new response header Accept-Patch used to specify the patch document formats accepted by the server. Accept-Patch SHOULD appear in the OPTIONS response for any resource that supports the use of the PATCH method. The presence of the Accept-Patch header in response to any method is an implicit indication that PATCH is allowed on the resource identified by the Request-URI.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789#section-3.1)" | [PATCH Method for HTTP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789 "Several applications extending the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) require a feature to do partial resource modification. The existing HTTP PUT method only allows a complete replacement of a document. This proposal adds a new HTTP method, PATCH, to modify an existing HTTP resource." )
`Accept-Post` | "[Accept-Post SHOULD appear in the OPTIONS response for any resource that supports the use of the POST method. The presence of the Accept-Post header in response to any method is an implicit indication that POST is allowed on the resource identified by the Request-URI. The presence of a specific document format in this header indicates that that specific format is allowed on the resource identified by the Request-URI.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-accept-post-01#section-3)" | [The Accept-Post HTTP Header](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-accept-post "This specification defines a new HTTP response header field Accept-Post, which indicates server support for specific media types for entity bodies in HTTP POST requests." )
`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` | "[The Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header indicates whether the response to request can be exposed when the omit credentials flag is unset. When part of the response to a preflight request it indicates that the actual request can include user credentials.](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-allow-credentials-response-header)" | [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/ "This document defines a mechanism to enable client-side cross-origin requests. Specifications that enable an API to make cross-origin requests to resources can use the algorithms defined by this specification. If such an API is used on http://example.org resources, a resource on http://hello-world.example can opt in using the mechanism described by this specification (e.g., specifying Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.org as response header), which would allow that resource to be fetched cross-origin from http://example.org." )
`Access-Control-Allow-Headers` | "[The Access-Control-Allow-Headers header indicates, as part of the response to a preflight request, which header field names can be used during the actual request.](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-allow-headers-response-header)" | [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/ "This document defines a mechanism to enable client-side cross-origin requests.

This scheme is not considered to be a secure method of user authentication (unless used in conjunction with some external secure system such as SSL), as the user name and password are passed over the network as cleartext. This document also provides the specification for HTTP's authentication framework, the original Basic authentication scheme and a scheme based on cryptographic hashes, referred to as ”Digest Access Authentication”. It is therefore also intended to serve as a replacement for RFC 2069. Some optional elements specified by RFC 2069 have been removed from this specification due to problems found since its publication; other new elements have been added for compatibility, those new elements have been made optional, but are strongly recommended. Like Basic, Digest access authentication verifies that both parties to a communication know a shared secret (a password); unlike Basic, this verification can be done without sending the password in the clear, which is Basic's biggest weakness. As with most other authentication protocols, the greatest sources of risks are usually found not in the core protocol itself but in policies and procedures surrounding its use." )

It also provides a process for end-users to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials (typically, a username and password pair), using user-agent redirections." )
`Content-Disposition` | "[The Content-Disposition response header field is used to convey additional information about how to process the response payload, and also can be used to attach additional metadata, such as the filename to use when saving the response payload locally.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6266#section-4)" | [Use of the Content-Disposition Header Field in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6266 "RFC 2616 defines the Content-Disposition response header field, but points out that it is not part of the HTTP/1.1 Standard.

It also defines mechanisms for sites to signal whether and how they honor this preference, both in the form of a machine-readable tracking status resource at a well-known location and via a ”Tk” response header field, and a mechanism for allowing the user to approve exceptions to DNT as desired." )
`Last-Event-ID` | "[The Last-Event-ID HTTP header specifies the value of the event source's last event ID string, encoded as UTF-8.](http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/#last-event-id)" | [Server-Sent Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/ " specification defines an API for opening an HTTP connection for receiving push notifications from a server in the form of DOM events.

`Prefer` | "[The Prefer request header field is used to indicate that particular server behaviors are preferred by the client, but not required for successful completion of the request.  Prefer is similar in nature to the Expect header field with the exception that servers are allowed to ignore stated preferences.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-snell-http-prefer#section-2)" | [Prefer Header for HTTP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-snell-http-prefer "This specification defines an HTTP header field that can be used by a client to request that certain behaviors be employed by a server while processing a request." )
`Slug` | "[Slug is an HTTP entity-header whose presence in a POST to a Collection constitutes a request by the client to use the header's value as part of any URIs that would normally be used to retrieve the to-be-created Entry or Media Resources.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023#section-9.7)" | [Atom Publishing Protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023 "The Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) is an application-level protocol for publishing and editing Web resources. The protocol is based on HTTP transfer of Atom-formatted representations. The Atom format is documented in the Atom Syndication Format." )
`Tk` | "[The Tk response header field is defined as an OPTIONAL means for indicating the tracking status that applied to the corresponding request, and as a REQUIRED means for indicating that a state-changing request has resulted in an interactive change to the tracking status.](http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/#response-header-field)" | [Tracking Preference Expression](http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/ "This specification defines the technical mechanisms for expressing a tracking preference via the DNT request header field in HTTP, via an HTML DOM property readable by embedded scripts, and via properties accessible to various user agent plug-in or extension APIs.

`X-Frame-Options` | "[The X-Frame-Options HTTP header field indicates a policy that specifies whether the browser should render the transmitted resource within a <frame> or an <iframe>.
