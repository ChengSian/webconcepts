The following 54 HTTP header field definitions were found in 44 services (6 [W3C](../W3C/), 22 [RFC](../IETF/RFC/), 16 [I-D](../IETF/I-D)):

Header Field | Description | Specification
-------: | :---------- | :---
`Accept` | "[The "Accept" header field can be used by user agents to specify response media types that are acceptable. Accept header fields can be used to indicate that the request is specifically limited to a small set of desired types, as in the case of a request for an in-line image.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics#section-5.3.2)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

`Accept-Charset` | "[The "Accept-Charset" header field can be sent by a user agent to indicate what charsets are acceptable in textual response content. This field allows user agents capable of understanding more comprehensive or special-purpose charsets to signal that capability to an origin server that is capable of representing information in those charsets.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics#section-5.3.3)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

`Accept-Datetime` | "[The "Accept-Datetime" request header is transmitted by a user agent to indicate it wants to access a past state of an Original Resource. To that end, the "Accept-Datetime" header is conveyed in an HTTP request issued against a TimeGate for an Original Resource, and its value indicates the datetime of the desired past state of the Original Resource.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-vandesompel-memento#section-2.1.1)" | [HTTP framework for time-based access to resource states - Memento](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-vandesompel-memento "The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web.

Datetime negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime. TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior states of the given resource. The framework also facilitates recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of another resource." )
`Accept-Encoding` | "[The "Accept-Encoding" header field can be used by user agents to indicate what response content-codings are acceptable in the response. An "identity" token is used as a synonym for "no encoding" in order to communicate when no encoding is preferred.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics#section-5.3.4)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

`Content-Type` | "[The "Content-Type" header field indicates the media type of the associated representation: either the representation enclosed in the message payload or the selected representation, as determined by the message semantics.

Intermediaries can choose to discard the request or serve it from cache rather than forwarding it to an origin server. This enables constrained origin servers, such as those that rely on battery power, to avoid expending limited resources on serving requests." )

Specifications that enable an API to make cross-origin requests to resources can use the algorithms defined by this specification. If such an API is used on http://example.org resources, a resource on http://hello-world.example can opt in using the mechanism described by this specification (e.g., specifying Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.org as response header), which would allow that resource to be fetched cross-origin from http://example.org." )
`Pragma` | "[The "Pragma" header field allows backwards compatibility with HTTP/1.0 caches, so that clients can specify a "no-cache" request that they will understand (as Cache-Control was not defined until HTTP/1.1). When the Cache-Control header field is also present and understood in a request, Pragma is ignored.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p6-cache#section-5.4)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p6-cache "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

`Prefer` | "[The Prefer request header field is used to indicate that particular server behaviors are preferred by the client, but not required for successful completion of the request. Prefer is similar in nature to the Expect header field with the exception that servers are allowed to ignore stated preferences.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-snell-http-prefer#section-2)" | [Prefer Header for HTTP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-snell-http-prefer "This specification defines an HTTP header field that can be used by a client to request that certain behaviors be employed by a server while processing a request." )

`Retry-After` | "[Servers send the "Retry-After" header field to indicate how long the user agent ought to wait before making a follow-up request. When sent with a 503 (Service Unavailable) response, Retry-After indicates how long the service is expected to be unavailable to the client.

`Server` | "[The "Server" header field contains information about the software used by the origin server to handle the request, which is often used by clients to help identify the scope of reported interoperability problems, to work around or tailor requests to avoid particular server limitations, and for analytics regarding server or operating system use.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics#section-7.4.2)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p2-semantics "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

This scheme is not considered to be a secure method of user authentication (unless used in conjunction with some external secure system such as SSL), as the user name and password are passed over the network as cleartext. This document also provides the specification for HTTP's authentication framework, the original Basic authentication scheme and a scheme based on cryptographic hashes, referred to as ”Digest Access Authentication”. It is therefore also intended to serve as a replacement for RFC 2069. Some optional elements specified by RFC 2069 have been removed from this specification due to problems found since its publication; other new elements have been added for compatibility, those new elements have been made optional, but are strongly recommended. Like Basic, Digest access authentication verifies that both parties to a communication know a shared secret (a password); unlike Basic, this verification can be done without sending the password in the clear, which is Basic's biggest weakness. As with most other authentication protocols, the greatest sources of risks are usually found not in the core protocol itself but in policies and procedures surrounding its use." )
`Warning` | "[The "Warning" header field is used to carry additional information about the status or transformation of a message that might not be reflected in the status code.
