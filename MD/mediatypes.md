Media Type | Description | Specification
-------: | :---------- | :---
`application/activity+json` | "[In the most basic sense, an "activity" is a semantic description of a potential or completed action. In the former case, the activity expresses what can or might be done with a particular object, while in the latter case, it expresses what has already been done. It is the goal of this specification to provide a JSON-based syntax that is sufficient to express metadata about activities in a rich, human-friendly, machine-processable and extensible manner. This may include constructing natural-language descriptions or visual representations about the activity, associating actionable information with various types of objects, communicating or recording activity logs, or delegation of potential actions to other applications.](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/activitystreams-core/#introduction)" | [**W3C TR activitystreams-core**: Activity Streams 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/ "This specification details a model for representing potential and completed activities using the JSON format." )
`application/atom+xml` | "[This specification describes two kinds of Atom Documents: Atom Feed Documents and Atom Entry Documents. Both kinds of Atom Documents are specified in terms of the XML Information Set, serialized as XML 1.0 and identified with the "application/atom+xml" media type. Atom Documents MUST be well-formed XML.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-2)" | [**RFC 4287**: Atom Syndication Format](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287 "Atom is an XML-based document format that describes lists of related information known as ”feeds”.

`application/json` | "[JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a text format for the serialization of structured data. It is derived from the object literals of JavaScript, as defined in the ECMAScript Programming Language Standard, Third Edition. JSON can represent four primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans, and null) and two structured types (objects and arrays). A string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters. An object is an unordered collection of zero or more name/value pairs, where a name is a string and a value is a string, number, boolean, null, object, or array. An array is an ordered sequence of zero or more values. The terms "object" and "array" come from the conventions of JavaScript. JSON's design goals were for it to be minimal, portable, textual, and a subset of JavaScript.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-1)" | [**RFC 7159**: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159 "JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight, text-based, language-independent data interchange format. It was derived from the ECMAScript Programming Language Standard. JSON defines a small set of formatting rules for the portable representation of structured data." )
`application/ld+json` | "[Generally speaking, the data model used for JSON-LD is a labeled, directed graph. The graph contains nodes, which are connected by edges. A node is typically data such as a string, number, typed values (like dates and times) or an IRI. There is also a special class of node called a blank node, which is typically used to express data that does not have a global identifier like an IRI. Blank nodes are identified using a blank node identifier.](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#data-model-overview)" | [**W3C TR json-ld**: JSON-LD 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/ "JSON is a useful data serialization and messaging format. This specification defines JSON-LD, a JSON-based format to serialize Linked Data. The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed systems that already use JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to JSON-LD. It is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments, to build interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines." )
`application/link-format` | "[The CoRE Link Format extends the HTTP Link Header field specified in RFC 5988.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6690#section-2)" | [**RFC 6690**: Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6690 "This specification defines Web Linking using a link format for use by constrained web servers to describe hosted resources, their attributes, and other relationships between links. Based on the HTTP Link Header field defined in RFC 5988, the Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format is carried as a payload and is assigned an Internet media type. ”RESTful” refers to the Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture. A well-known URI is defined as a default entry point for requesting the links hosted by a server." )
`application/manifest+json` | "[A manifest is a JSON document that contains startup parameters and application defaults for when a web application is launched. A manifest consists of a top-level object that contains zero or more members.](http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#manifest-and-its-members)" | [**W3C TR appmanifest**: Manifest for Web Application](http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/ "This specification defines a JSON-based manifest that provides developers with a centralized place to put metadata associated with a web application. This includes, but is not limited to, the web application's name, links to icons, as well as the preferred URL to open when a user launches the web application. The manifest also allows developers to declare a default orientation for their web application, as well as providing the ability to set the display mode for the application (e.g., in fullscreen). Additionally, the manifest allows a developer to ”scope” a web application to a URL. This restricts the URLs to which the application can be navigated and provides a means to ”deep link” into a web application from other applications. Using this metadata, user agents can provide developers with means to create user experiences that are more comparable to that of a native application. In addition, this specification defines the manifest link type, which provides a declarative means for a document to be associated with a manifest." )
`application/patch-ops-error+xml` | "[A new MIME error format is defined for applications that require deterministic error handling when patching cannot be applied.

In order to send changes to an XML document, an entire copy of the new version must be sent, unless there is a means of indicating only the portions that have changed. This document describes an XML patch framework utilizing XML Path language (XPath) selectors. These selector values and updated new data content constitute the basis of patch operations described in this document. In addition to them, with basic <add>, <replace>, and <remove> directives a set of patches can then be applied to update an existing XML document." )
