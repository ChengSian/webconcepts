Media Types
==============

The following media type definitions were found in 25 services (5 [W3C](../W3C/), 13 [RFC](../IETF/RFC/), 7 [I-D](../IETF/I-D)):

* application/api-problem+json : [HTTP Problem Detail](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-problem "This document defines a "problem detail" as a way to carry machine-readable details of errors in a HTTP response, to avoid the need to invent new error response formats for HTTP APIs." )
* application/api-problem+xml : [HTTP Problem Detail](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-problem "This document defines a "problem detail" as a way to carry machine-readable details of errors in a HTTP response, to avoid the need to invent new error response formats for HTTP APIs." )
* application/atom+xml : [Atom Syndication Format](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287 "Atom is an XML-based document format that describes lists of related information known as "feeds". Feeds are composed of a number of items, known as "entries", each with an extensible set of attached metadata. For example, each entry has a title." )
* application/atomcat+xml : [Atom Publishing Protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023 "The Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) is an application-level protocol for publishing and editing Web resources. The protocol is based on HTTP transfer of Atom-formatted representations. The Atom format is documented in the Atom Syndication Format." )
* application/atomdeleted+xml : [The Atom "deleted-entry" Element](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6721 "This specification adds mechanisms to the Atom Syndication Format that publishers of Atom Feed and Entry documents can use to explicitly identify Atom entries that have been removed." )
* application/atomsvc+xml : [Atom Publishing Protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023 "The Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) is an application-level protocol for publishing and editing Web resources. The protocol is based on HTTP transfer of Atom-formatted representations. The Atom format is documented in the Atom Syndication Format." )
* application/home+json : [Home Documents](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home "This document proposes a "home document" format for non-browser HTTP clients." )
* application/home+xml : [Home Documents](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-home-xml "The current draft for HTTP Home Documents provides a JSON syntax only. This draft provides an XML syntax for the same underlying data model, so that the concept of HTTP Home Documents can be consistently exposed in both JSON- and XML-based HTTP services." )
* application/jrd+json : [WebFinger](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7033 "This specification defines the WebFinger protocol, which can be used to discover information about people or other entities on the Internet using standard HTTP methods. WebFinger discovers information for a URI that might not be usable as a locator otherwise, such as account or email URIs." )
* application/ldesc+xml : [Link Descriptions](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-link-desc "Interactions with many resources on the Web are driven by links, and these links often define certain expectations about the interactions (such as HTTP methods being used, media types being sent in the request, or URI parameters being used in a certain way). While these expectations are essential to define the possible framework for interactions, it may be useful to further narrow them down by providing link descriptions, which can help clients to gain more runtime knowledge about the resource they are about to interact with. This memo defines Link Descriptions, a schema and a media type that can be used to describe links by supporting descriptive markup for representing interaction information with links. Link Descriptions can be used by media types (by inclusion or by reference) that seek to make Link Descriptions runtime-capable, without having to create their own representation." )
* application/trig : [TriG](http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/ "The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a general-purpose language for representing information in the Web. This document defines a textual syntax for RDF called TriG that allows an RDF dataset to be completely written in a compact and natural text form, with abbreviations for common usage patterns and datatypes. TriG is an extension of the Turtle [turtle] format." )
* application/vcard+xml : [xCard: vCard XML Representation](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6351 "This document defines the XML schema of the vCard data format." )
* text/event-stream : [Server-Sent Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/ " specification defines an API for opening an HTTP connection for receiving push notifications from a server in the form of DOM events. The API is designed such that it can be extended to work with other push notification schemes such as Push SMS." )
* text/html : [Hypertext Markup Language](http://www.w3.org/TR/html4 "This specification defines the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the publishing language of the World Wide Web. This specification defines HTML 4.01, which is a subversion of HTML 4. In addition to the text, multimedia, and hyperlink features of the previous versions of HTML (HTML 3.2 and HTML 2.0), HTML 4 supports more multimedia options, scripting languages, style sheets, better printing facilities, and documents that are more accessible to users with disabilities. HTML 4 also takes great strides towards the internationalization of documents, with the goal of making the Web truly World Wide." )
* text/vcard : [vCard Format Specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350 "This document defines the vCard data format for representing and exchanging a variety of information about individuals and other entities (e.g., formatted and structured name and delivery addresses, email address, multiple telephone numbers, photograph, logo, audio clips, etc.).  This document obsoletes RFCs 2425, 2426, and 4770, and updates RFC 2739." )
