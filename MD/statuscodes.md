Status Code | Description | Specification
-------: | :---------- | :---
`206: Partial Content` | "[The 206 (Partial Content) status code indicates that the server is successfully fulfilling a range request for the target resource by transferring one or more parts of the selected representation that correspond to the satisfiable ranges found in the request's Range header field.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233#section-4.1)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Range Requests](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines range requests and the rules for constructing and combining responses to those requests." )
`304: Not Modified` | "[The 304 (Not Modified) status code indicates that a conditional GET or HEAD request has been received and would have resulted in a 200 (OK) response if it were not for the fact that the condition evaluated to false. In other words, there is no need for the server to transfer a representation of the target resource because the request indicates that the client, which made the request conditional, already has a valid representation; the server is therefore redirecting the client to make use of that stored representation as if it were the payload of a 200 (OK) response.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-4.1)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines HTTP/1.1 conditional requests, including metadata header fields for indicating state changes, request header fields for making preconditions on such state, and rules for constructing the responses to a conditional request when one or more preconditions evaluate to false." )
`308: Permanent Redirect` | "[The 308 (Permanent Redirect) status code indicates that the target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7538#section-3)" | [The Hypertext Transfer Protocol Status Code 308 (Permanent Redirect)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7538 "This document specifies the additional Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) status code 308 (Permanent Redirect)." )
`412: Precondition Failed` | "[The 412 (Precondition Failed) status code indicates that one or more conditions given in the request header fields evaluated to false when tested on the server. This response code allows the client to place preconditions on the current resource state (its current representations and metadata) and, thus, prevent the request method from being applied if the target resource is in an unexpected state.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-4.2)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines HTTP/1.1 conditional requests, including metadata header fields for indicating state changes, request header fields for making preconditions on such state, and rules for constructing the responses to a conditional request when one or more preconditions evaluate to false." )
`416: Range Not Satisfiable` | "[The 416 (Range Not Satisfiable) status code indicates that none of the ranges in the request's Range header field (Section 3.1) overlap the current extent of the selected resource or that the set of ranges requested has been rejected due to invalid ranges or an excessive request of small or overlapping ranges.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233#section-4.4)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Range Requests](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines range requests and the rules for constructing and combining responses to those requests." )
`418: I'm a teapot` | "[Any attempt to brew coffee with a teapot should result in the error code "418 I'm a teapot". The resulting entity body MAY be short and stout.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2324#section-2.3.2)" | [Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP/1.0)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2324 "This document describes HTCPCP, a protocol for controlling, monitoring, and diagnosing coffee pots." )
`451: Unavailable For Legal Reasons` | "[This status code indicates that the server is denying access to the resource as a consequence of a legal demand. The server in question might not be an origin server. This type of legal demand typically most directly affects the operations of ISPs and search engines.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7725#section-3)" | [An HTTP Status Code to Report Legal Obstacles](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7725 "This document specifies a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) status code for use when resource access is denied as a consequence of legal demands." )
