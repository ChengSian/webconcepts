# HTTP Status Codes

The following 22 HTTP status code definitions were found in 121 services (29 [W3C](../W3C/), 71 [RFC](../IETF/RFC/), 21 [I-D](../IETF/I-D)):

Status Code | Description | Specification
-------: | :---------- | :---
`102: Processing` | "[The 102 (Processing) status code is an interim response used to inform the client that the server has accepted the complete request, but has not yet completed it. This status code SHOULD only be sent when the server has a reasonable expectation that the request will take significant time to complete. As guidance, if a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but arbitrary value) to process the server SHOULD return a 102 (Processing) response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2518#section-10.1)" | [HTTP Extensions for Distributed Authoring - WEBDAV](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2518 "This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and content-types ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management of resource properties, creation and management of resource collections, namespace manipulation, and resource locking (collision avoidance)." )
`206: Partial Content` | "[The 206 (Partial Content) status code indicates that the server is successfully fulfilling a range request for the target resource by transferring one or more parts of the selected representation that correspond to the satisfiable ranges found in the request's Range header field.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233#section-4.1)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Range Requests](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines range requests and the rules for constructing and combining responses to those requests." )
`207: Multi-Status` | "[The 207 (Multi-Status) status code provides status for multiple independent operations.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-11.1)" | [HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918 "Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) consists of a set of methods, headers, and content-types ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management of resource properties, creation and management of resource collections, URL namespace manipulation, and resource locking (collision avoidance)." )
`208: Already Reported` | "[The 208 (Already Reported) status code can be used inside a DAV: propstat response element to avoid enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection repeatedly. For each binding to a collection inside the request's scope, only one will be reported with a 200 status, while subsequent DAV:response elements for all other bindings will use the 208 status, and no DAV:response elements for their descendants are included.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5842#section-7.1)" | [Binding Extensions to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5842 "This specification defines bindings, and the BIND method for creating multiple bindings to the same resource. Creating a new binding to a resource causes at least one new URI to be mapped to that resource. Servers are required to ensure the integrity of any bindings that they allow to be created." )
`226: IM Used` | "[The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance. The actual current instance might not be available except by combining this response with other previous or future responses, as appropriate for the specific instance-manipulation(s).](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3229#section-10.4.1)" | [Delta encoding in HTTP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3229 "This document describes how delta encoding can be supported as a compatible extension to HTTP/1.1. Many HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) requests cause the retrieval of slightly modified instances of resources for which the client already has a cache entry. Research has shown that such modifying updates are frequent, and that the modifications are typically much smaller than the actual entity. In such cases, HTTP would make more efficient use of network bandwidth if it could transfer a minimal description of the changes, rather than the entire new instance of the resource. This is called ”delta encoding.”" )
`304: Not Modified` | "[The 304 (Not Modified) status code indicates that a conditional GET or HEAD request has been received and would have resulted in a 200 (OK) response if it were not for the fact that the condition evaluated to false. In other words, there is no need for the server to transfer a representation of the target resource because the request indicates that the client, which made the request conditional, already has a valid representation; the server is therefore redirecting the client to make use of that stored representation as if it were the payload of a 200 (OK) response.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-4.1)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines HTTP/1.1 conditional requests, including metadata header fields for indicating state changes, request header fields for making preconditions on such state, and rules for constructing the responses to a conditional request when one or more preconditions evaluate to false." )
`308: Permanent Redirect` | "[The 308 (Permanent Redirect) status code indicates that the target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7538#section-3)" | [The Hypertext Transfer Protocol Status Code 308 (Permanent Redirect)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7538 "This document specifies the additional Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) status code 308 (Permanent Redirect)." )
`412: Precondition Failed` | "[The 412 (Precondition Failed) status code indicates that one or more conditions given in the request header fields evaluated to false when tested on the server. This response code allows the client to place preconditions on the current resource state (its current representations and metadata) and, thus, prevent the request method from being applied if the target resource is in an unexpected state.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-4.2)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines HTTP/1.1 conditional requests, including metadata header fields for indicating state changes, request header fields for making preconditions on such state, and rules for constructing the responses to a conditional request when one or more preconditions evaluate to false." )
`416: Range Not Satisfiable` | "[The 416 (Range Not Satisfiable) status code indicates that none of the ranges in the request's Range header field (Section 3.1) overlap the current extent of the selected resource or that the set of ranges requested has been rejected due to invalid ranges or an excessive request of small or overlapping ranges.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233#section-4.4)" | [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Range Requests](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines range requests and the rules for constructing and combining responses to those requests." )
`418: I'm a teapot` | "[Any attempt to brew coffee with a teapot should result in the error code "418 I'm a teapot". The resulting entity body MAY be short and stout.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2324#section-2.3.2)" | [Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP/1.0)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2324 "This document describes HTCPCP, a protocol for controlling, monitoring, and diagnosing coffee pots." )
`422: Unprocessable Entity` | "[The 422 (Unprocessable Entity) status code means the server understands the content type of the request entity (hence a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a 400 (Bad Request) status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained instructions. For example, this error condition may occur if an XML request body contains well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), but semantically erroneous, XML instructions.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-11.2)" | [HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918 "Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) consists of a set of methods, headers, and content-types ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management of resource properties, creation and management of resource collections, URL namespace manipulation, and resource locking (collision avoidance)." )
`423: Locked` | "[The 423 (Locked) status code means the source or destination resource of a method is locked. This response SHOULD contain an appropriate precondition or postcondition code, such as 'lock-token-submitted' or 'no-conflicting-lock'.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-11.3)" | [HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918 "Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) consists of a set of methods, headers, and content-types ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management of resource properties, creation and management of resource collections, URL namespace manipulation, and resource locking (collision avoidance)." )
`424: Failed Dependency` | "[The 424 (Failed Dependency) status code means that the method could not be performed on the resource because the requested action depended on another action and that action failed. For example, if a command in a PROPPATCH method fails, then, at minimum, the rest of the commands will also fail with 424 (Failed Dependency).](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-11.4)" | [HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918 "Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) consists of a set of methods, headers, and content-types ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management of resource properties, creation and management of resource collections, URL namespace manipulation, and resource locking (collision avoidance)." )
`428: Precondition Required` | "[The 428 status code indicates that the origin server requires the request to be conditional.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-3)" | [Additional HTTP Status Codes](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585 "This document specifies additional HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) status codes for a variety of common situations." )
`429: Too Many Requests` | "[The 429 status code indicates that the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting").](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-4)" | [Additional HTTP Status Codes](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585 "This document specifies additional HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) status codes for a variety of common situations." )
`431: Request Header Fields Too Large` | "[The 431 status code indicates that the server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields are too large. The request MAY be resubmitted after reducing the size of the request header fields.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-5)" | [Additional HTTP Status Codes](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585 "This document specifies additional HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) status codes for a variety of common situations." )
`451: Unavailable For Legal Reasons` | "[This status code indicates that the server is denying access to the resource as a consequence of a legal demand. The server in question might not be an origin server. This type of legal demand typically most directly affects the operations of ISPs and search engines.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7725#section-3)" | [An HTTP Status Code to Report Legal Obstacles](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7725 "This document specifies a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) status code for use when resource access is denied as a consequence of legal demands." )
`506: Variant Also Negotiates` | "[The 506 status code indicates that the server has an internal configuration error: the chosen variant resource is configured to engage in transparent content negotiation itself, and is therefore not a proper end point in the negotiation process.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7725#section-3)" | [Transparent Content Negotiation in HTTP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2295 "HTTP allows web site authors to put multiple versions of the same information under a single URL. Transparent content negotiation is an extensible negotiation mechanism, layered on top of HTTP, for automatically selecting the best version when the URL is accessed. This enables the smooth deployment of new web data formats and markup tags." )
`507: Insufficient Storage` | "[The 507 (Insufficient Storage) status code means the method could not be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store the representation needed to successfully complete the request. This condition is considered to be temporary. If the request that received this status code was the result of a user action, the request MUST NOT be repeated until it is requested by a separate user action.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-11.5)" | [HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918 "Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) consists of a set of methods, headers, and content-types ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management of resource properties, creation and management of resource collections, URL namespace manipulation, and resource locking (collision avoidance)." )
`508: Loop Detected` | "[The 508 (Loop Detected) status code indicates that the server terminated an operation because it encountered an infinite loop while processing a request with "Depth: infinity". This status indicates that the entire operation failed.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5842#section-7.1)" | [Binding Extensions to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5842 "This specification defines bindings, and the BIND method for creating multiple bindings to the same resource. Creating a new binding to a resource causes at least one new URI to be mapped to that resource. Servers are required to ensure the integrity of any bindings that they allow to be created." )
`510: Not Extended` | "[The policy for accessing the resource has not been met in the request. The server should send back all the information necessary for the client to issue an extended request. It is outside the scope of this specification to specify how the extensions inform the client.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2774#section-7)" | [An HTTP Extension Framework](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2774 "A wide range of applications have proposed various extensions of the HTTP protocol. Current efforts span an enormous range, including distributed authoring, collaboration, printing, and remote procedure call mechanisms. These HTTP extensions are not coordinated, since there has been no standard framework for defining extensions and thus, separation of concerns. This document describes a generic extension mechanism for HTTP, which is designed to address the tension between private agreement and public specification and to accommodate extension of applications using HTTP clients, servers, and proxies. The proposal associates each extension with a globally unique identifier, and uses HTTP header fields to carry the extension identifier and related information between the parties involved in the extended communication." )
`511: Network Authentication Required` | "[The 511 status code indicates that the client needs to authenticate to gain network access.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-6)" | [Additional HTTP Status Codes](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585 "This document specifies additional HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) status codes for a variety of common situations." )
