    <title short="POWDER-DR">Protocol for Web Description Resources (POWDER): Description Resources</title>
    <documentation source="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">The purpose of the Protocol for Web Description Resources (POWDER) is to provide a means for individuals or organizations to describe a group of resources through the publication of machine-readable metadata, as motivated by the POWDER Use Cases. This document details the creation and lifecycle of Description Resources (DRs), which encapsulate such metadata. These are typically represented in a highly constrained XML dialect that is relatively human-readable. The meaning of such DRs are underpinned by formal semantics, accessible by performing a GRDDL Transform.</documentation>

        <documentation source="http://www.w3.org/TR/powder-dr/#semlink">We define the RDF property wdrs:describedby with a domain of rdf:Resource and a range of wdrs:Document. This is the class of POWDER documents and is a sub class of owl:Ontology. The meaning of wdrs:describedby is identical to the describedby relationship type defined above so that: http://www.w3.org/2007/05/powder-s#describedby and http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/describedby have the same meaning and could be used interchangeably although the context in which they are used will usually determine which is the more appropriate.</documentation>
