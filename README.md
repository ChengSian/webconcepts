# Web Concepts

This is the repository for the [Web Concepts site published at `webconcepts.info`](http://webconcepts.info/).

## Setup

There probably should be a bit of documentation about how all of this works... A very high-level overview is this:

* New categories ([concepts](http://webconcepts.info/concepts) or [specification organizations/series](http://webconcepts.info/specs)) get added via XML configuration files ([`concepts.xml`](concepts.xml) and [`specs.xml`](specs.xml)).

* New specification data gets added to the specification source directory [`/src/specs`](src/specs) as individual XML files. These specification files contain information about the concept values that are defined by the specifications.

You can find additional information on how to [fork the repo](forking) and how to [add](adding) or [remove](removing) Web Concepts. After forking, adding, or removing, you also need information on [building Web Concepts](building).
