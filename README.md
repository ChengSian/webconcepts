Service Documentation Language (Sedola)
=======================================

Work in progress, with the ultimate goal being a language that allows the description of REST services, focusing on those facets of the services that matter from the REST point of view, such as media types, link relations, and HTTP headers.

Since many REST services are reusing existing standards, it makes sense to make the description of those standards available in reusable form. For now, there are some [W3C](W3C/) and [IETF](IETF/) (with [RFC](IETF/RFC/) as well as [I-D](IETF/I-D) documents) available, and this collection is expected to grow continually.
