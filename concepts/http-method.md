[`ACL`](/concepts/http-method/ACL) | [**RFC 3744**: Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Access Control Protocol](/specs/IETF/RFC/3744 "This document specifies a set of methods, headers, message bodies, properties, and reports that define Access Control extensions to the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol. This protocol permits a client to read and modify access control lists that instruct a server whether to allow or deny operations upon a resource (such as HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) method invocations) by a given principal. A lightweight representation of principals as Web resources supports integration of a wide range of user management repositories. Search operations allow discovery and manipulation of principals using human names.")
