**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/COWL: Confinement with Origin Web Labels](/specs/W3C/TR/COWL "This specification defines an API for specifying privacy and integrity policies on data, in the form of origin labels, and a mechanism for confining code according to such policies. This allows Web application authors and server operators to share data with untrusted—buggy but not malicious—code (e.g., in a mashup scenario) yet impose restrictions on how the code can share the data further."):** [The Sec-COWL HTTP request and response headers are used by user agents and servers to convey label metadata to servers and user agents, respectively.](http://www.w3.org/TR/COWL/#header "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Sec-COWL&#34;")
