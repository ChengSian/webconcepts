**[RFC 7240: Prefer Header for HTTP](/specs/IETF/RFC/7240 "This specification defines an HTTP header field that can be used by a client to request that certain behaviors be employed by a server while processing a request."):** [The Prefer request header field is used to indicate that particular server behaviors are preferred by the client, but not required for successful completion of the request. Prefer is similar in nature to the Expect header field with the exception that servers are allowed to ignore stated preferences.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7240#section-2)
