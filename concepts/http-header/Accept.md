[**RFC 7231**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](/specs/IETF/RFC/7231 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines the semantics of HTTP/1.1 messages as expressed by request methods, request header fields, response status codes, and response header fields, along with the payload of messages (metadata and body content) and mechanisms for content negotiation."): [The "Accept" header field can be used by user agents to specify response media types that are acceptable. Accept header fields can be used to indicate that the request is specifically limited to a small set of desired types, as in the case of a request for an in-line image.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.2)
