**[RFC 2965: HTTP State Management Mechanism](/specs/IETF/RFC/2965 "This document specifies a way to create a stateful session with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests and responses. It describes three new headers, Cookie, Cookie2, and Set-Cookie2, which carry state information between participating origin servers and user agents. The method described here differs from Netscape's Cookie proposal [Netscape], but it can interoperate with HTTP/1.0 user agents that use Netscape's method."):** [The Cookie2 request header facilitates interoperation between clients and servers that understand different versions of the cookie specification.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2965#section-3.3)
