**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/cors: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](/specs/W3C/TR/cors "This document defines a mechanism to enable client-side cross-origin requests. Specifications that enable an API to make cross-origin requests to resources can use the algorithms defined by this specification. If such an API is used on http://example.org resources, a resource on http://hello-world.example can opt in using the mechanism described by this specification (e.g., specifying Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.org as response header), which would allow that resource to be fetched cross-origin from http://example.org."):** [The Access-Control-Expose-Headers header indicates which headers are safe to expose to the API of a CORS API specification.](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-expose-headers-response-header)
