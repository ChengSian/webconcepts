**[Internet Draft ietf-httpbis-client-hints: HTTP Client Hints](/specs/IETF/I-D/ietf-httpbis-client-hints "An increasing diversity of Web-connected devices and software capabilities has created a need to deliver optimized content for each device. This specification defines a set of HTTP request header fields, colloquially known as Client Hints, to address this. They are intended to be used as input to proactive content negotiation; just as the Accept header allows clients to indicate what formats they prefer, Client Hints allow clients to indicate a list of device and agent specific preferences."):** [The "DPR" header field is a number that, in requests, indicates the client's current Device Pixel Ratio (DPR), which is the ratio of physical pixels over CSS px of the layout viewport on the device.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-hints#section-3 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;DPR&#34;")
