[**Internet Draft ietf-httpbis-client-hints**: HTTP Client Hints](/specs/IETF/I-D/ietf-httpbis-client-hints "An increasing diversity of Web-connected devices and software capabilities has created a need to deliver optimized content for each device. This specification defines a set of HTTP request header fields, colloquially known as Client Hints, to address this. They are intended to be used as input to proactive content negotiation; just as the Accept header allows clients to indicate what formats they prefer, Client Hints allow clients to indicate a list of device and agent specific preferences."): [The "Content-DPR" header field is a number that indicates the ratio between physical pixels over CSS px of the selected image response.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-hints#section-3.1)
