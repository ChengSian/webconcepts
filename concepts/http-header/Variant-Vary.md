[**RFC 2295**: Transparent Content Negotiation in HTTP](/specs/IETF/RFC/2295 "HTTP allows web site authors to put multiple versions of the same information under a single URL. Transparent content negotiation is an extensible negotiation mechanism, layered on top of HTTP, for automatically selecting the best version when the URL is accessed. This enables the smooth deployment of new web data formats and markup tags."): [The Variant-Vary response header can be used in a choice response to record any vary information which applies to the variant data (the entity body combined with some of the entity headers) contained in the response, rather than to the response as a whole.]()
