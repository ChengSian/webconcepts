[**RFC 6265**: HTTP State Management Mechanism](/specs/IETF/RFC/6265 "This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields. These header fields can be used by HTTP servers to store state (called cookies) at HTTP user agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the mostly stateless HTTP protocol. Although cookies have many historical infelicities that degrade their security and privacy, the Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields are widely used on the Internet."): [The Set-Cookie HTTP response header is used to send cookies from the server to the user agent.]()
