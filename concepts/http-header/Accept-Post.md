**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp: Linked Data Platform 1.0 (LDP)](/specs/W3C/TR/ldp "Linked Data Platform (LDP) defines a set of rules for HTTP operations on web resources, some based on RDF, to provide an architecture for read-write Linked Data on the web."):** [The Accept-Post HTTP header SHOULD appear in the OPTIONS response for any resource that supports the use of the POST method. The presence of the Accept-Post header in response to any method is an implicit indication that POST is allowed on the resource identified by the Request-URI. The presence of a specific document format in this header indicates that that specific format is allowed on POST requests to the resource identified by the Request-URI.](http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#header-accept-post "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Accept-Post&#34;")
