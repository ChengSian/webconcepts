description: "The Accept-Post HTTP header SHOULD appear in the OPTIONS response for any resource that supports the use of the POST method. The presence of the Accept-Post header in response to any method is an implicit indication that POST is allowed on the resource identified by the Request-URI. The presence of a specific document format in this header indicates that that specific format is allowed on POST requests to the resource identified by the Request-URI."
