[The Link header field provides a means for serialising one or more links into HTTP headers.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-rfc5988bis#section-3 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Link&#34;") (**[Internet Draft nottingham-rfc5988bis: Web Linking](/specs/IETF/I-D/nottingham-rfc5988bis "This specification defines a way to indicate the relationships between resources on the Web (&#34;links&#34;) and the type of those relationships (&#34;link relation types&#34;). It also defines the use of such links in HTTP headers with the Link header field.")**)

[The Link entity-header field provides a means for serialising one or more links in HTTP headers. It is semantically equivalent to the <LINK> element in HTML, as well as the atom:link feed-level element in Atom.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-5 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Link&#34;") (**[RFC 5988: Web Linking](/specs/IETF/RFC/5988 "This document specifies relation types for Web links, and defines a registry for them. It also defines the use of such links in HTTP headers with the Link header field.")**)
