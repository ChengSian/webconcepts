**[RFC 5988: Web Linking](/specs/IETF/RFC/5988 "This document specifies relation types for Web links, and defines a registry for them. It also defines the use of such links in HTTP headers with the Link header field."):** [The Link entity-header field provides a means for serialising one or more links in HTTP headers. It is semantically equivalent to the <LINK> element in HTML, as well as the atom:link feed-level element in Atom.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-5)
