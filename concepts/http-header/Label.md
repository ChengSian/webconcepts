**[RFC 3253: Versioning Extensions to WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)](/specs/IETF/RFC/3253 "This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and resource types that define the WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol. WebDAV versioning will minimize the complexity of clients that are capable of interoperating with a variety of versioning repository managers, to facilitate widespread deployment of applications capable of utilizing the WebDAV Versioning services. WebDAV versioning includes automatic versioning for versioning-unaware clients, version history management, workspace management, baseline management, activity management, and URL namespace versioning."):** [For certain methods (e.g. GET, PROPFIND), if the request-URL identifies a version-controlled resource, a label can be specified in a Label request header to cause the method to be applied to the version selected by that label from the version history of that version-controlled resource.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253#section-8.3)
