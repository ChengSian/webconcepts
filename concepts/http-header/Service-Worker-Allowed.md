[An HTTP response to a service worker's script resource request can include the Service-Worker-Allowed header. It indicates that the user agent will override the path restriction, which limits the maximum allowed scope url that the script can control, to the given value.](http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers-1/#service-worker-script-response "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Service-Worker-Allowed&#34;") (**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers-1: Service Workers 1](/specs/W3C/TR/service-workers-1 "This specification describes a method that enables applications to take advantage of persistent background processing, including hooks to enable bootstrapping of web applications while offline. The core of this system is an event-driven Web Worker, which responds to events dispatched from documents and other sources. A system for managing installation, versions, and upgrades is provided. The service worker is a generic entry point for event-driven background processing in the Web Platform that is extensible by other specifications.")**)
