[Servers can advertise support for Client Hints using the Accept-CH header field or an equivalent HTML meta element with http-equiv attribute.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-hints#section-2.2.1 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Accept-CH&#34;") (**[Internet Draft ietf-httpbis-client-hints: HTTP Client Hints](/specs/IETF/I-D/ietf-httpbis-client-hints "An increasing diversity of Web-connected devices and software capabilities has created a need to deliver optimized content for each device. This specification defines a set of HTTP request header fields, colloquially known as Client Hints, to address this. They are intended to be used as input to proactive content negotiation; just as the Accept header allows clients to indicate what formats they prefer, Client Hints allow clients to indicate a list of device and agent specific preferences.")**)
