This document, along with its normative references, includes all the specification necessary for the implementation of interoperable P3P applications."):** [Any document retrieved by HTTP may point to a policy reference file through the use of a new response header, the P3P header. If a site is using P3P headers, it SHOULD include this on responses for all appropriate request methods, including HEAD and OPTIONS requests. The P3P header gives one or more comma-separated directives.](http://www.w3.org/TR/P3P/#syntax_ext)
