**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt: Tracking Preference Expression (DNT)](/specs/W3C/TR/tracking-dnt "This specification defines the technical mechanisms for expressing a tracking preference via the DNT request header field in HTTP, via an HTML DOM property readable by embedded scripts, and via properties accessible to various user agent plug-in or extension APIs. It also defines mechanisms for sites to signal whether and how they honor this preference, both in the form of a machine-readable tracking status resource at a well-known location and via a &#34;Tk&#34; response header field, and a mechanism for allowing the user to approve exceptions to DNT as desired."):** [The DNT header field is defined as the means for expressing a user's tracking preference via HTTP.](http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/#dnt-header-field)
