[An HTTP request to fetch a service worker's script resource will include the Service-Worker header. It indicates that this request is a service worker's script resource request.](http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers-1/#service-worker-script-request "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Service-Worker&#34;") (**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers-1: Service Workers 1](/specs/W3C/TR/service-workers-1 "This specification describes a method that enables applications to take advantage of persistent background processing, including hooks to enable bootstrapping of web applications while offline. The core of this system is an event-driven Web Worker, which responds to events dispatched from documents and other sources. A system for managing installation, versions, and upgrades is provided. The service worker is a generic entry point for event-driven background processing in the Web Platform that is extensible by other specifications.")**)
