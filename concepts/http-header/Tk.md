It also defines mechanisms for sites to signal whether and how they honor this preference, both in the form of a machine-readable tracking status resource at a well-known location and via a &#34;Tk&#34; response header field, and a mechanism for allowing the user to approve exceptions to DNT as desired."):** [The Tk response header field is defined as an OPTIONAL means for indicating the tracking status that applied to the corresponding request, and as a REQUIRED means for indicating that a state-changing request has resulted in an interactive change to the tracking status.](http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/#response-header-field "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Tk&#34;")
