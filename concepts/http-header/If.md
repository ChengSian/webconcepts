**[RFC 4918: HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)](/specs/IETF/RFC/4918 "Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) consists of a set of methods, headers, and content-types ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management of resource properties, creation and management of resource collections, URL namespace manipulation, and resource locking (collision avoidance)."):** [The If request header is intended to have similar functionality to the If-Match header defined in Section 14.24 of RFC 2616. However, the If header handles any state token as well as ETags. A typical example of a state token is a lock token, and lock tokens are the only state tokens defined in this specification.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-10.4)
