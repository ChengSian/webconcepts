HTTP Cache Directive | Specification
-------: | :-------
[`immutable`](/concepts/http-cache-directive/immutable "When present in an HTTP response, the immutable Cache-Control extension indicates that the origin server MUST NOT update the representation of that resource during the freshness lifetime of the response.") | [**RFC 8246**: HTTP Immutable Responses](/specs/IETF/RFC/8246 "The immutable HTTP response Cache-Control extension allows servers to identify resources that will not be updated during their freshness lifetime. This ensures that a client never needs to revalidate a cached fresh resource to be certain it has not been modified.")
[`inv-maxage`](/concepts/http-cache-directive/inv-maxage "When present, the 'inv-maxage' cache-control extension indicates the number of seconds that caches who implement Linked Cache invalidation can consider responses fresh for, provided they are not invalidated.") | [**Internet Draft nottingham-linked-cache-inv**: Linked Cache Invalidation](/specs/IETF/I-D/nottingham-linked-cache-inv "This memo defines two new link types that indicate relationships between resources in terms of cache invalidation, along with a HTTP cache-control extension that takes advantage of those relationships to use them to extend response freshness. Collectively, this is referred to as Linked Cache Invalidation (LCI).")
[`max-age`](/concepts/http-cache-directive/max-age "The &#34;max-age&#34; request directive indicates that the client is unwilling to accept a response whose age is greater than the specified number of seconds. Unless the max-stale request directive is also present, the client is not willing to accept a stale response. The &#34;max-age&#34; response directive indicates that the response is to be considered stale after its age is greater than the specified number of seconds.") | [**RFC 7234**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching](/specs/IETF/RFC/7234 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines requirements on HTTP caches and the associated header fields that control cache behavior or indicate cacheable response messages.")
[`max-stale`](/concepts/http-cache-directive/max-stale "The &#34;max-stale&#34; request directive indicates that the client is willing to accept a response that has exceeded its freshness lifetime. If max-stale is assigned a value, then the client is willing to accept a response that has exceeded its freshness lifetime by no more than the specified number of seconds. If no value is assigned to max-stale, then the client is willing to accept a stale response of any age.") | [**RFC 7234**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching](/specs/IETF/RFC/7234 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines requirements on HTTP caches and the associated header fields that control cache behavior or indicate cacheable response messages.")
[`min-fresh`](/concepts/http-cache-directive/min-fresh "The &#34;min-fresh&#34; request directive indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose freshness lifetime is no less than its current age plus the specified time in seconds. That is, the client wants a response that will still be fresh for at least the specified number of seconds.") | [**RFC 7234**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching](/specs/IETF/RFC/7234 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines requirements on HTTP caches and the associated header fields that control cache behavior or indicate cacheable response messages.")
[`must-revalidate`](/concepts/http-cache-directive/must-revalidate "The &#34;must-revalidate&#34; response directive indicates that once it has become stale, a cache MUST NOT use the response to satisfy subsequent requests without successful validation on the origin server.") | [**RFC 7234**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching](/specs/IETF/RFC/7234 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines requirements on HTTP caches and the associated header fields that control cache behavior or indicate cacheable response messages.")
[`no-cache`](/concepts/http-cache-directive/no-cache "The &#34;no-cache&#34; request directive indicates that a cache MUST NOT use a stored response to satisfy the request without successful validation on the origin server. The &#34;no-cache&#34; response directive indicates that the response MUST NOT be used to satisfy a subsequent request without successful validation on the origin server. This allows an origin server to prevent a cache from using it to satisfy a request without contacting it, even by caches that have been configured to send stale responses.") | [**RFC 7234**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching](/specs/IETF/RFC/7234 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines requirements on HTTP caches and the associated header fields that control cache behavior or indicate cacheable response messages.")
[`no-store`](/concepts/http-cache-directive/no-store "The &#34;no-store&#34; directive indicates that a cache MUST NOT store any part of either this request or any response to it. This directive applies to both private and shared caches. &#34;MUST NOT store&#34; in this context means that the cache MUST NOT intentionally store the information in non-volatile storage, and MUST make a best-effort attempt to remove the information from volatile storage as promptly as possible after forwarding it.") | [**RFC 7234**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching](/specs/IETF/RFC/7234 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines requirements on HTTP caches and the associated header fields that control cache behavior or indicate cacheable response messages.")
[`no-transform`](/concepts/http-cache-directive/no-transform "The &#34;no-transform&#34; directive indicates that an intermediary (whether or not it implements a cache) MUST NOT transform the payload.") | [**RFC 7234**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching](/specs/IETF/RFC/7234 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines requirements on HTTP caches and the associated header fields that control cache behavior or indicate cacheable response messages.")
[`only-if-cached`](/concepts/http-cache-directive/only-if-cached "The &#34;only-if-cached&#34; request directive indicates that the client only wishes to obtain a stored response. If it receives this directive, a cache SHOULD either respond using a stored response that is consistent with the other constraints of the request, or respond with a 504 (Gateway Timeout) status code. If a group of caches is being operated as a unified system with good internal connectivity, a member cache MAY forward such a request within that group of caches.") | [**RFC 7234**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching](/specs/IETF/RFC/7234 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines requirements on HTTP caches and the associated header fields that control cache behavior or indicate cacheable response messages.")
[`private`](/concepts/http-cache-directive/private "The &#34;private&#34; response directive indicates that the response message is intended for a single user and MUST NOT be stored by a shared cache. A private cache MAY store the response and reuse it for later requests, even if the response would normally be non-cacheable.") | [**RFC 7234**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching](/specs/IETF/RFC/7234 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines requirements on HTTP caches and the associated header fields that control cache behavior or indicate cacheable response messages.")
[`proxy-revalidate`](/concepts/http-cache-directive/proxy-revalidate "The &#34;proxy-revalidate&#34; response directive has the same meaning as the must-revalidate response directive, except that it does not apply to private caches.") | [**RFC 7234**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching](/specs/IETF/RFC/7234 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines requirements on HTTP caches and the associated header fields that control cache behavior or indicate cacheable response messages.")
[`public`](/concepts/http-cache-directive/public "The &#34;public&#34; response directive indicates that any cache MAY store the response, even if the response would normally be non-cacheable or cacheable only within a private cache.") | [**RFC 7234**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching](/specs/IETF/RFC/7234 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines requirements on HTTP caches and the associated header fields that control cache behavior or indicate cacheable response messages.")
[`s-maxage`](/concepts/http-cache-directive/s-maxage "The &#34;s-maxage&#34; response directive indicates that, in shared caches, the maximum age specified by this directive overrides the maximum age specified by either the max-age directive or the Expires header field. The s-maxage directive also implies the semantics of the proxy-revalidate response directive.") | [**RFC 7234**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching](/specs/IETF/RFC/7234 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines requirements on HTTP caches and the associated header fields that control cache behavior or indicate cacheable response messages.")
[`stale-if-error`](/concepts/http-cache-directive/stale-if-error "The stale-if-error Cache-Control extension indicates that when an error is encountered, a cached stale response MAY be used to satisfy the request, regardless of other freshness information.") | [**RFC 5861**: HTTP Cache-Control Extensions for Stale Content](/specs/IETF/RFC/5861 "This document defines two independent HTTP Cache-Control extensions that allow control over the use of stale responses by caches.")
[`stale-while-revalidate`](/concepts/http-cache-directive/stale-while-revalidate "When present in an HTTP response, the stale-while-revalidate Cache-Control extension indicates that caches MAY serve the response in which it appears after it becomes stale, up to the indicated number of seconds.") | [**RFC 5861**: HTTP Cache-Control Extensions for Stale Content](/specs/IETF/RFC/5861 "This document defines two independent HTTP Cache-Control extensions that allow control over the use of stale responses by caches.")
