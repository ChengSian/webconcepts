HTTP Content Coding | Specification
-------: | :-------
[`br`](/concepts/http-content-coding/br) | [**RFC 7932**: Brotli Compressed Data Format](/specs/IETF/RFC/7932 "This specification defines a lossless compressed data format that compresses data using a combination of the LZ77 algorithm and Huffman coding, with efficiency comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods.")
