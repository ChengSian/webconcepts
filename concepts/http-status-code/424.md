title:  "HTTP Status Code: 424 Failed Dependency"
---

**[RFC 4918: HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)](/specs/IETF/RFC/4918 "Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) consists of a set of methods, headers, and content-types ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management of resource properties, creation and management of resource collections, URL namespace manipulation, and resource locking (collision avoidance)."):** [The 424 (Failed Dependency) status code means that the method could not be performed on the resource because the requested action depended on another action and that action failed. For example, if a command in a PROPPATCH method fails, then, at minimum, the rest of the commands will also fail with 424 (Failed Dependency).](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#section-11.4 "Read documentation for HTTP Status Code &#34;424&#34;")
