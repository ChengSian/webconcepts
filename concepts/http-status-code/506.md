title:  "HTTP Status Code: 506: Variant Also Negotiates"
---

[**RFC 2295**: Transparent Content Negotiation in HTTP](/specs/IETF/RFC/2295 "HTTP allows web site authors to put multiple versions of the same information under a single URL. Transparent content negotiation is an extensible negotiation mechanism, layered on top of HTTP, for automatically selecting the best version when the URL is accessed. This enables the smooth deployment of new web data formats and markup tags."): [The 506 status code indicates that the server has an internal configuration error: the chosen variant resource is configured to engage in transparent content negotiation itself, and is therefore not a proper end point in the negotiation process.]()
