title:  "HTTP Status Code: 407 Proxy Authentication Required"
---

**[RFC 7235: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Authentication](/specs/IETF/RFC/7235 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. This document defines the HTTP Authentication framework."):** [The 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) status code is similar to 401 (Unauthorized), but it indicates that the client needs to authenticate itself in order to use a proxy. The proxy MUST send a Proxy-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to that proxy for the target resource. The client MAY repeat the request with a new or replaced Proxy-Authorization header field.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-3.2 "Read documentation for HTTP Status Code &#34;407&#34;")
