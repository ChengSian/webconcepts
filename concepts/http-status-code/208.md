title:  "HTTP Status Code: 208: Already Reported"

**[RFC 5842: Binding Extensions to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)](/specs/IETF/RFC/5842 "This specification defines bindings, and the BIND method for creating multiple bindings to the same resource. Creating a new binding to a resource causes at least one new URI to be mapped to that resource. Servers are required to ensure the integrity of any bindings that they allow to be created."):** [The 208 (Already Reported) status code can be used inside a DAV: propstat response element to avoid enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection repeatedly. For each binding to a collection inside the request's scope, only one will be reported with a 200 status, while subsequent DAV:response elements for all other bindings will use the 208 status, and no DAV:response elements for their descendants are included.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5842#section-7.1)
