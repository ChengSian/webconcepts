description: "The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance. The actual current instance might not be available except by combining this response with other previous or future responses, as appropriate for the specific instance-manipulation(s)."

**[RFC 3229: Delta encoding in HTTP](/specs/IETF/RFC/3229 "This document describes how delta encoding can be supported as a compatible extension to HTTP/1.1. Many HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) requests cause the retrieval of slightly modified instances of resources for which the client already has a cache entry. Research has shown that such modifying updates are frequent, and that the modifications are typically much smaller than the actual entity. In such cases, HTTP would make more efficient use of network bandwidth if it could transfer a minimal description of the changes, rather than the entire new instance of the resource. This is called &#34;delta encoding.&#34;"):** [The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance. The actual current instance might not be available except by combining this response with other previous or future responses, as appropriate for the specific instance-manipulation(s).](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3229#section-10.4.1 "Read documentation for HTTP Status Code &#34;226&#34;")
