URI Scheme | Specification
-------: | :-------
[`about`](/concepts/uri-scheme/about) | [**RFC 6694**: The "about" URI Scheme](/specs/IETF/RFC/6694 "This document describes the &#34;about&#34; URI scheme, which is widely used by Web browsers and some other applications to designate access to their internal resources, such as settings, application information, hidden built-in functionality, and so on.")
[`cap`](/concepts/uri-scheme/cap) | [**RFC 4324**: Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)](/specs/IETF/RFC/4324 "The Calendar Access Protocol (CAP) described in this memo permits a Calendar User (CU) to utilize a Calendar User Agent (CUA) to access an iCAL-based Calendar Store (CS). At the time of this writing, three vendors are implementing CAP, but it has already been determined that some changes are needed. In order to get implementation experience, the participants felt that a CAP specification is needed to preserve many years of work. Many properties in CAP which have had many years of debate, can be used by other iCalendar protocols.")
[`data`](/concepts/uri-scheme/data) | [**RFC 2397**: The "data" URL scheme](/specs/IETF/RFC/2397 "A new URL scheme, &#34;data&#34;, is defined. It allows inclusion of small data items as &#34;immediate&#34; data, as if it had been included externally.")
[`dns`](/concepts/uri-scheme/dns) | [**RFC 4501**: Domain Name System Uniform Resource Identifiers](/specs/IETF/RFC/4501 "This document defines Uniform Resource Identifiers for Domain Name System resources.")

A 'geo' URI identifies a physical location in a two- or three-dimensional coordinate reference system in a compact, simple, human-readable, and protocol-independent way. The default coordinate reference system used is the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84).")
[`http`](/concepts/uri-scheme/http) | [**RFC 7230**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing](/specs/IETF/RFC/7230 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. HTTP has been in use by the World Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This document provides an overview of HTTP architecture and its associated terminology, defines the &#34;http&#34; and &#34;https&#34; Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes, defines the HTTP/1.1 message syntax and parsing requirements, and describes general security concerns for implementations.")
[`https`](/concepts/uri-scheme/https) | [**RFC 7230**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing](/specs/IETF/RFC/7230 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

[`im`](/concepts/uri-scheme/im) | [**RFC 3860**: Common Profile for Instant Messaging (CPIM)](/specs/IETF/RFC/3860 "At the time this document was written, numerous instant messaging protocols were in use, and little interoperability between services based on these protocols has been achieved. This specification defines common semantics and data formats for instant messaging to facilitate the creation of gateways between instant messaging services.")
[`info`](/concepts/uri-scheme/info) | [**RFC 4452**: The "info" URI Scheme for Information Assets with Identifiers in Public Namespaces](/specs/IETF/RFC/4452 "This document defines the &#34;info&#34; Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for information assets with identifiers in public namespaces. Namespaces participating in the &#34;info&#34; URI scheme are regulated by an &#34;info&#34; Registry mechanism.")
[`mailto`](/concepts/uri-scheme/mailto) | [**RFC 6068**: The 'mailto' URI Scheme](/specs/IETF/RFC/6068 "This document defines the format of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to identify resources that are reached using Internet mail. It adds better internationalization and compatibility with Internationalized Resource Identifiers to the previous syntax of 'mailto' URIs.")
[`ni`](/concepts/uri-scheme/ni) | [**RFC 6920**: Naming Things with Hashes](/specs/IETF/RFC/6920 "This document defines a set of ways to identify a thing (a digital object in this case) using the output from a hash function. It specifies a new URI scheme for this purpose, a way to map these to HTTP URLs, and binary and human-speakable formats for these names. The various formats are designed to support, but not require, a strong link to the referenced object, such that the referenced object may be authenticated to the same degree as the reference to it. The reason for this work is to standardise current uses of hash outputs in URLs and to support new information-centric applications and other uses of hash outputs in protocols.")
[`nih`](/concepts/uri-scheme/nih) | [**RFC 6920**: Naming Things with Hashes](/specs/IETF/RFC/6920 "This document defines a set of ways to identify a thing (a digital object in this case) using the output from a hash function.

[`reload`](/concepts/uri-scheme/reload) | [**RFC 6940**: REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol](/specs/IETF/RFC/6940 "This specification defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), a peer-to-peer (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet. A P2P signaling protocol provides its clients with an abstract storage and messaging service between a set of cooperating peers that form the overlay network. RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by other applications with similar requirements by defining new usages that specify the Kinds of data that need to be stored for a particular application. RELOAD defines a security model based on a certificate enrollment service that provides unique identities. NAT traversal is a fundamental service of the protocol. RELOAD also allows access from &#34;client&#34; nodes that do not need to route traffic or store data for others.")
[`session`](/concepts/uri-scheme/session) | [**RFC 6768**: Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2)](/specs/IETF/RFC/6768 "The Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) allows client hosts to control media service resources such as speech synthesizers, recognizers, verifiers, and identifiers residing in servers on the network. MRCPv2 is not a &#34;stand-alone&#34; protocol -- it relies on other protocols, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), to coordinate MRCPv2 clients and servers and manage sessions between them, and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to describe, discover, and exchange capabilities. It also depends on SIP and SDP to establish the media sessions and associated parameters between the media source or sink and the media server. Once this is done, the MRCPv2 exchange operates over the control session established above, allowing the client to control the media processing resources on the speech resource server.")
[`sms`](/concepts/uri-scheme/sms) | [**RFC 5724**: URI Scheme for Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) Short Message Service (SMS)](/specs/IETF/RFC/5724 "This memo specifies the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme &#34;sms&#34; for specifying one or more recipients for an SMS message.

The purpose of this document is to allow RFC 1738 to be made obsolete while keeping the information about the scheme on standards track.")
[`ws`](/concepts/uri-scheme/ws) | [**RFC 6455**: The WebSocket Protocol](/specs/IETF/RFC/6455 "The WebSocket Protocol enables two-way communication between a client running untrusted code in a controlled environment to a remote host that has opted-in to communications from that code. The security model used for this is the origin-based security model commonly used by web browsers. The protocol consists of an opening handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP. The goal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based applications that need two-way communication with servers that does not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.g., using XMLHttpRequest or <iframe>s and long polling).")
[`wss`](/concepts/uri-scheme/wss) | [**RFC 6455**: The WebSocket Protocol](/specs/IETF/RFC/6455 "The WebSocket Protocol enables two-way communication between a client running untrusted code in a controlled environment to a remote host that has opted-in to communications from that code.
