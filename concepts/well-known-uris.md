The following 8 Well-Known URI definitions (8 distinct values) were found in [136 specifications](/specs). Please be advised that the table shown here is maintained and compiled from [Web Concepts](/) sources. The [official Well-Known URI registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml) is maintained by the [*Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)*](http://www.iana.org/).

Well-Known URI | Specification
-------: | :-------
[`caldav`](/concepts/well-known-uri/caldav) | [**RFC 6764**: Locating Services for Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV) and vCard Extensions to WebDAV (CardDAV)](/specs/IETF/RFC/6764 "This specification describes how DNS SRV records, DNS TXT records, and well-known URIs can be used together or separately to locate CalDAV (Calendaring Extensions to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)) or CardDAV (vCard Extensions to WebDAV) services.")
[`carddav`](/concepts/well-known-uri/carddav) | [**RFC 6764**: Locating Services for Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV) and vCard Extensions to WebDAV (CardDAV)](/specs/IETF/RFC/6764 "This specification describes how DNS SRV records, DNS TXT records, and well-known URIs can be used together or separately to locate CalDAV (Calendaring Extensions to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)) or CardDAV (vCard Extensions to WebDAV) services.")
[`core`](/concepts/well-known-uri/core) | [**RFC 6690**: Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format](/specs/IETF/RFC/6690 "This specification defines Web Linking using a link format for use by constrained web servers to describe hosted resources, their attributes, and other relationships between links. Based on the HTTP Link Header field defined in RFC 5988, the Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format is carried as a payload and is assigned an Internet media type. &#34;RESTful&#34; refers to the Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture. A well-known URI is defined as a default entry point for requesting the links hosted by a server.")
[`genid`](/concepts/well-known-uri/genid) | [**W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts**: RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax](/specs/W3C/TR/rdf11-concepts "The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for representing information in the Web. This document defines an abstract syntax (a data model) which serves to link all RDF-based languages and specifications. The abstract syntax has two key data structures: RDF graphs are sets of subject-predicate-object triples, where the elements may be IRIs, blank nodes, or datatyped literals. They are used to express descriptions of resources. RDF datasets are used to organize collections of RDF graphs, and comprise a default graph and zero or more named graphs. RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax also introduces key concepts and terminology, and discusses datatyping and the handling of fragment identifiers in IRIs within RDF graphs.")
[`posh`](/concepts/well-known-uri/posh) | [**RFC 7711**: PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7711 "Experience has shown that it is difficult to deploy proper PKIX certificates for Transport Layer Security (TLS) in multi-tenanted environments. As a result, domains hosted in such environments often deploy applications using certificates that identify the hosting service, not the hosted domain. Such deployments force end users and peer services to accept a certificate with an improper identifier, resulting in degraded security. This document defines methods that make it easier to deploy certificates for proper server identity checking in non-HTTP application protocols. Although these methods were developed for use in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as a Domain Name Association (DNA) prooftype, they might also be usable in other non-HTTP application protocols.")
[`timezone`](/concepts/well-known-uri/timezone) | [**RFC 7808**: Time Zone Data Distribution Service](/specs/IETF/RFC/7808 "This document defines a time zone data distribution service that allows reliable, secure, and fast delivery of time zone data and leap-second rules to client systems such as calendaring and scheduling applications or operating systems.")
[`void`](/concepts/well-known-uri/void) | [**W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/void**: Describing Linked Datasets with the VoID Vocabulary](/specs/W3C/TR/void "VoID is an RDF Schema vocabulary for expressing metadata about RDF datasets. It is intended as a bridge between the publishers and users of RDF data, with applications ranging from data discovery to cataloging and archiving of datasets. This document is a detailed guide to the VoID vocabulary. It describes how VoID can be used to express general metadata based on Dublin Core, access metadata, structural metadata, and links between datasets. It also provides deployment advice and discusses the discovery of VoID descriptions.")
[`webfinger`](/concepts/well-known-uri/webfinger) | [**RFC 7033**: WebFinger](/specs/IETF/RFC/7033 "This specification defines the WebFinger protocol, which can be used to discover information about people or other entities on the Internet using standard HTTP methods. WebFinger discovers information for a URI that might not be usable as a locator otherwise, such as account or email URIs.")
