HTTP Header Field | Specification
-------: | :-------
[`A-IM`](/concepts/http-header/A-IM) | [**RFC 3229**: Delta encoding in HTTP](/specs/IETF/RFC/3229 "This document describes how delta encoding can be supported as a compatible extension to HTTP/1.1. Many HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) requests cause the retrieval of slightly modified instances of resources for which the client already has a cache entry. Research has shown that such modifying updates are frequent, and that the modifications are typically much smaller than the actual entity. In such cases, HTTP would make more efficient use of network bandwidth if it could transfer a minimal description of the changes, rather than the entire new instance of the resource. This is called &#34;delta encoding.&#34;")
[`ALPN`](/concepts/http-header/ALPN) | [**RFC 7639**: The ALPN HTTP Header Field](/specs/IETF/RFC/7639 "This specification allows HTTP CONNECT requests to indicate what protocol is intended to be used within the tunnel once established, using the ALPN header field.")
[`Accept`](/concepts/http-header/Accept) | [**RFC 7231**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](/specs/IETF/RFC/7231 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines the semantics of HTTP/1.1 messages as expressed by request methods, request header fields, response status codes, and response header fields, along with the payload of messages (metadata and body content) and mechanisms for content negotiation.")
[`Accept-Additions`](/concepts/http-header/Accept-Additions "2 definitions") | [**RFC 2324**: Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP/1.0)](/specs/IETF/RFC/2324 "This document describes HTCPCP, a protocol for controlling, monitoring, and diagnosing coffee pots.")<br/>[**RFC 7168**: The Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol for Tea Efflux Appliances (HTCPCP-TEA)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7168 "The Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP) specification does not allow for the brewing of tea, in all its variety and complexity. This paper outlines an extension to HTCPCP to allow for pots to provide networked tea-brewing facilities.")
[`Accept-Charset`](/concepts/http-header/Accept-Charset) | [**RFC 7231**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](/specs/IETF/RFC/7231 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

[`Accept-Datetime`](/concepts/http-header/Accept-Datetime) | [**RFC 7089**: HTTP framework for time-based access to resource states - Memento](/specs/IETF/RFC/7089 "The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web. It facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given resource by introducing datetime negotiation and TimeMaps. Datetime negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime. TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior states of the given resource. The framework also facilitates recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of another resource.")

In particular, the &#34;gzip&#34; content coding is widely used for payload data sent in response messages. Content codings can be used in request messages as well, however discoverability is not on par with response messages. This document extends the HTTP &#34;Accept-Encoding&#34; header field for use in responses, to indicate that content codings are supported in requests.")
[`Accept-Features`](/concepts/http-header/Accept-Features) | [**RFC 2295**: Transparent Content Negotiation in HTTP](/specs/IETF/RFC/2295 "HTTP allows web site authors to put multiple versions of the same information under a single URL.

[`Want-Digest`](/concepts/http-header/Want-Digest) | [**RFC 3230**: Instance Digests in HTTP](/specs/IETF/RFC/3230 "HTTP/1.1 defines a Content-MD5 header that allows a server to include a digest of the response body.  However, this is specifically defined to cover the body of the actual message, not the contents of the full file (which might be quite different, if the response is a Content-Range, or uses a delta encoding).  Also, the Content-MD5 is limited to one specific digest algorithm; other algorithms, such as SHA-1 (Secure Hash Standard), may be more appropriate in some circumstances.  Finally, HTTP/1.1 provides no explicit mechanism by which a client may request a digest.  This document proposes HTTP extensions that solve these problems.")

This specification defines a set of HTTP request header fields, colloquially known as Client Hints, to address this. They are intended to be used as input to proactive content negotiation; just as the Accept header allows clients to indicate what formats they prefer, Client Hints allow clients to indicate a list of device and agent specific preferences.")
