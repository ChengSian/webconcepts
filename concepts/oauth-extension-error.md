OAuth Extensions Error | Specification
-------: | :-------
[`insufficient_scope`](/concepts/oauth-extension-error/insufficient_scope) | [**RFC 6750**: The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage](/specs/IETF/RFC/6750 "This specification describes how to use bearer tokens in HTTP requests to access OAuth 2.0 protected resources. Any party in possession of a bearer token (a &#34;bearer&#34;) can use it to get access to the associated resources (without demonstrating possession of a cryptographic key). To prevent misuse, bearer tokens need to be protected from disclosure in storage and in transport.")
[`invalid_request`](/concepts/oauth-extension-error/invalid_request) | [**RFC 6750**: The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage](/specs/IETF/RFC/6750 "This specification describes how to use bearer tokens in HTTP requests to access OAuth 2.0 protected resources. Any party in possession of a bearer token (a &#34;bearer&#34;) can use it to get access to the associated resources (without demonstrating possession of a cryptographic key).

[`unsupported_token_type`](/concepts/oauth-extension-error/unsupported_token_type) | [**RFC 7009**: OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation](/specs/IETF/RFC/7009 "This document proposes an additional endpoint for OAuth authorization servers, which allows clients to notify the authorization server that a previously obtained refresh or access token is no longer needed. This allows the authorization server to clean up security credentials. A revocation request will invalidate the actual token and, if applicable, other tokens based on the same authorization grant.")
