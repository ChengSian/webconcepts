**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/exi: Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) Format 1.0](/specs/W3C/TR/exi "This document is the specification of the Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) format. EXI is a very compact representation for the Extensible Markup Language (XML) Information Set that is intended to simultaneously optimize performance and the utilization of computational resources. The EXI format uses a hybrid approach drawn from the information and formal language theories, plus practical techniques verified by measurements, for entropy encoding XML information. Using a relatively simple algorithm, which is amenable to fast and compact implementation, and a small set of datatype representations, it reliably produces efficient encodings of XML event streams. The grammar production system and format definition of EXI are presented."):** [A new media type registration "application/exi" described below is being proposed for community review, with the intent to eventually submit it to the IESG for review, approval, and registration with IANA.](http://www.w3.org/TR/exi/#internetMediaType "Read documentation for Media Type &#34;application/exi&#34;")
