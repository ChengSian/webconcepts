**[RFC 7049: Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7049 "The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. These design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1 and MessagePack."):** [CBOR follows some specific design goals that are not well met by current binary formats. The underlying data model is an extended version of the JSON data model.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049#section-1)
