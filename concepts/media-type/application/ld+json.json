The graph contains nodes, which are connected by edges. A node is typically data such as a string, number, typed values (like dates and times) or an IRI. There is also a special class of node called a blank node, which is typically used to express data that does not have a global identifier like an IRI. Blank nodes are identified using a blank node identifier.","documentation":"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/json-ld\/#data-model-overview","specification":"http:\/\/webconcepts.info\/specs\/W3C\/TR\/json-ld"}]}
