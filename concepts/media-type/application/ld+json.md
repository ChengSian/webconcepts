[**W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld**: JSON-LD 1.0](/specs/W3C/TR/json-ld "JSON is a useful data serialization and messaging format. This specification defines JSON-LD, a JSON-based format to serialize Linked Data. The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed systems that already use JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to JSON-LD. It is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments, to build interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines."): [Generally speaking, the data model used for JSON-LD is a labeled, directed graph. The graph contains nodes, which are connected by edges. A node is typically data such as a string, number, typed values (like dates and times) or an IRI. There is also a special class of node called a blank node, which is typically used to express data that does not have a global identifier like an IRI. Blank nodes are identified using a blank node identifier.]()
