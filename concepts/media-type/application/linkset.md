[This document format is identical to the payload of the HTTP Link header. It is defined in Section 3 of RFC 5988bis, more specifically by its ABNF production rule for "Link" and subsequent ones.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-linkset#section-5.1 "Read documentation for Media Type &#34;application/linkset&#34;") (**[Internet Draft wilde-linkset: Link Relation Types for Web Services](/specs/IETF/I-D/wilde-linkset "This specification defines a link relation type and media types for working with sets of links. Using this link relation type and/or the media types is useful when it becomes necessary to represent links outside the context of a resource they are linking. One typical example are scenarios in which the number of links to put in an HTTP Link header field is too big, and thus these links should become a resource of their own.")**)
