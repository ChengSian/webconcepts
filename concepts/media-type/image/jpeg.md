[JPEG File Interchange Format is a minimal file format which enables JPEG bitstreams to be exchanged between a wide variety of platforms and applications. This minimal format does not include any of the advanced features found in the TIFF JPEG specification or any application specific file format. Nor should it, for the only purpose of this simplified format is to allow the exchange of JPEG compressed images.](http://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:10918:-5 "Read documentation for Media Type &#34;image/jpeg&#34;") (**[ISO/IEC 10918-5: Information technology â€” Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images: JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF) ](/specs/ISO/IEC/10918-5 "The JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF) is a minimal file format which enables the exchange of JPEG encoded images (according to Rec. ITU-T T.81 | ISO/IEC 10918-1) having 1 or 3 colour channels and 8 bits per colour channel between a wide variety of platforms and applications. This minimal format does not include some advanced features found in various other specified file formats. The purpose of this format is to provide for a basic form of exchange of JPEG images. The optional inclusion of thumbnail images for rapid browsing is also supported.")**)
