description: "To publish information for global distribution, one needs a universally understood language, a kind of publishing mother tongue that all computers may potentially understand. The publishing language used by the World Wide Web is HTML (from HyperText Markup Language). HTML gives authors the means to publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.; retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button; design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.; and include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents."

**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/html4: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)](/specs/W3C/TR/html4 "This specification defines the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the publishing language of the World Wide Web. This specification defines HTML 4.01, which is a subversion of HTML 4. In addition to the text, multimedia, and hyperlink features of the previous versions of HTML (HTML 3.2 and HTML 2.0), HTML 4 supports more multimedia options, scripting languages, style sheets, better printing facilities, and documents that are more accessible to users with disabilities. HTML 4 also takes great strides towards the internationalization of documents, with the goal of making the Web truly World Wide."):** [To publish information for global distribution, one needs a universally understood language, a kind of publishing mother tongue that all computers may potentially understand.
