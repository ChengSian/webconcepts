The design can also be used in JavaScript-based authentication embedded in HTML. HOBA is an alternative to HTTP authentication schemes that require passwords and therefore avoids all problems related to passwords, such as leakage of server-side password databases."):** [HOBA-http uses a well-known URI "hoba" as a base URI for performing many tasks: "https://www.example.com/.well-known/hoba".
