**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/void: Describing Linked Datasets with the VoID Vocabulary](/specs/W3C/TR/void "VoID is an RDF Schema vocabulary for expressing metadata about RDF datasets. It is intended as a bridge between the publishers and users of RDF data, with applications ranging from data discovery to cataloging and archiving of datasets. This document is a detailed guide to the VoID vocabulary. It describes how VoID can be used to express general metadata based on Dublin Core, access metadata, structural metadata, and links between datasets. It also provides deployment advice and discusses the discovery of VoID descriptions."):** [The URI /.well-known/void on any Web server is registered by this specification for a VoID description of any datasets hosted on that server.
