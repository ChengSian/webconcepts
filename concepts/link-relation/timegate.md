**[RFC 7089: HTTP framework for time-based access to resource states - Memento](/specs/IETF/RFC/7089 "The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web. It facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given resource by introducing datetime negotiation and TimeMaps. Datetime negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime. TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior states of the given resource. The framework also facilitates recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of another resource."):** [A link with a "timegate" Relation Type is used to point from the Original Resource, as well as from a Memento associated with the Original Resource, to a TimeGate for the Original Resource.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089#section-2.2.2 "Read documentation for Link Relation &#34;timegate&#34;")
