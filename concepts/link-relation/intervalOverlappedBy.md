[Refers to a resource associated with a time interval that begins before the beginning of the time interval associated with the context resource, and ends after the beginning of the time interval associated with the context resource.](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/#time:intervalOverlappedBy "Read documentation for Link Relation &#34;intervalOverlappedBy&#34;") (**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time: Time Ontology in OWL](/specs/W3C/TR/owl-time "OWL-Time is an OWL-2 DL ontology of temporal concepts, for describing the temporal properties of resources in the world or described in Web pages. The ontology provides a vocabulary for expressing facts about topological (ordering) relations among instants and intervals, together with information about durations, and about temporal position including date-time information. Time positions and durations may be expressed using either the conventional (Gregorian) calendar and clock, or using another temporal reference system such as Unix-time, geologic time, or different calendars.")**)
