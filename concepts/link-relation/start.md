**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/html4: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)](/specs/W3C/TR/html4 "This specification defines the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the publishing language of the World Wide Web. This specification defines HTML 4.01, which is a subversion of HTML 4. In addition to the text, multimedia, and hyperlink features of the previous versions of HTML (HTML 3.2 and HTML 2.0), HTML 4 supports more multimedia options, scripting languages, style sheets, better printing facilities, and documents that are more accessible to users with disabilities. HTML 4 also takes great strides towards the internationalization of documents, with the goal of making the Web truly World Wide."):** [Refers to the first document in a collection of documents.
