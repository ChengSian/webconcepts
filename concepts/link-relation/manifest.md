**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest: Manifest for Web Application](/specs/W3C/TR/appmanifest "This specification defines a JSON-based manifest that provides developers with a centralized place to put metadata associated with a web application. This includes, but is not limited to, the web application's name, links to icons, as well as the preferred URL to open when a user launches the web application. The manifest also allows developers to declare a default orientation for their web application, as well as providing the ability to set the display mode for the application (e.g., in fullscreen). Additionally, the manifest allows a developer to &#34;scope&#34; a web application to a URL. This restricts the URLs to which the application can be navigated and provides a means to &#34;deep link&#34; into a web application from other applications. Using this metadata, user agents can provide developers with means to create user experiences that are more comparable to that of a native application. In addition, this specification defines the manifest link type, which provides a declarative means for a document to be associated with a manifest."):** [Imports or links to a manifest.](http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#linking "Read documentation for Link Relation &#34;manifest&#34;")
