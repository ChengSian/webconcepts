[The "linkset" link relation type is used by a resource to link to a resource that provides a set of links. Typically the Context IRI of these links  is the URI of the responding resource but links with other Context IRIs MAY be provided.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-linkset#section-4 "Read documentation for Link Relation &#34;linkset&#34;") (**[Internet Draft wilde-linkset: Link Relation Types for Web Services](/specs/IETF/I-D/wilde-linkset "This specification defines a link relation type and media types for working with sets of links. Using this link relation type and/or the media types is useful when it becomes necessary to represent links outside the context of a resource they are linking. One typical example are scenarios in which the number of links to put in an HTTP Link header field is too big, and thus these links should become a resource of their own.")**)
