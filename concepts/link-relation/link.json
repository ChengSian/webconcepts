     "description": "In the simplest case, a link relation type identifies the semantics of a link. For example, a link with the relation type \"copyright\" indicates that the resource identified by the target IRI is a statement of the copyright terms applying to the current context IRI. Link relation types can also be used to indicate that the target resource has particular attributes, or exhibits particular behaviours; for example, a \"service\" link implies that the identified resource is part of a defined protocol (in this case, a service description).",
