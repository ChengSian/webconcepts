**[RFC 5005: Feed Paging and Archiving](/specs/IETF/RFC/5005 "Syndicated Web feeds (using formats such as Atom) are often split into multiple documents to save bandwidth, allow &#34;sliding window&#34; access, or for other purposes. This specification formalizes two types of feeds that can span one or more feed documents; &#34;paged&#34; feeds and &#34;archived&#34; feeds. Additionally, it defines &#34;complete&#34; feeds to cover the case when a single feed document explicitly represents all of the feed's entries."):** [A URI that refers to the immediately following document in a series of documents.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005#section-3 "Read documentation for Link Relation &#34;next&#34;")

**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/html4: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)](/specs/W3C/TR/html4 "This specification defines the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the publishing language of the World Wide Web. This specification defines HTML 4.01, which is a subversion of HTML 4. In addition to the text, multimedia, and hyperlink features of the previous versions of HTML (HTML 3.2 and HTML 2.0), HTML 4 supports more multimedia options, scripting languages, style sheets, better printing facilities, and documents that are more accessible to users with disabilities. HTML 4 also takes great strides towards the internationalization of documents, with the goal of making the Web truly World Wide."):** [Refers to the next document in a linear sequence of documents.
