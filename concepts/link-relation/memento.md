[**RFC 7089**: HTTP framework for time-based access to resource states - Memento](/specs/IETF/RFC/7089 "The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web. It facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given resource by introducing datetime negotiation and TimeMaps. Datetime negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime. TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior states of the given resource. The framework also facilitates recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of another resource."): [A link with a "memento" Relation Type is used to point from a TimeGate or a Memento for an Original Resource, as well as from the Original Resource itself, to a Memento for the Original Resource.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089#section-2.2.4)
