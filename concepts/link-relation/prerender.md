[**W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-hints**: Resource Hints](/specs/W3C/TR/resource-hints "This specification defines the dns-prefetch, preconnect, prefetch, and prerender relationships of the HTML Link Element (<link>). These primitives enable the developer, and the server generating or delivering the resources, to assist the user agent in the decision process of which origins it should connect to, and which resources it should fetch and preprocess to improve page performance."): [The prerender link relation type is used to declare an HTML resource that might be required by the next navigation, and that the user agent SHOULD fetch and execute, such that the user agent can deliver faster response and processing once the resource is requested in the future.](http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-hints/#prerender)
