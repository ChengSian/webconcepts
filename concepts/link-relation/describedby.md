**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/powder-dr: Protocol for Web Description Resources (POWDER): Description Resources](/specs/W3C/TR/powder-dr "The purpose of the Protocol for Web Description Resources (POWDER) is to provide a means for individuals or organizations to describe a group of resources through the publication of machine-readable metadata, as motivated by the POWDER Use Cases. This document details the creation and lifecycle of Description Resources (DRs), which encapsulate such metadata. These are typically represented in a highly constrained XML dialect that is relatively human-readable. The meaning of such DRs are underpinned by formal semantics, accessible by performing a GRDDL Transform."):** [The relationship A 'describedby' B asserts that resource B provides a description of resource A.
