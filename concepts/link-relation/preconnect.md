These primitives enable the developer, and the server generating or delivering the resources, to assist the user agent in the decision process of which origins it should connect to, and which resources it should fetch and preprocess to improve page performance."):** [The preconnect link relation type is used to indicate an origin that will be used to fetch required resources.
