[Identifies a resource that provides a "home" document for the context resource. Home documents often serve as starting points for a certain resource context, such as for Web APIs where the home resource provides access to a number of "entry points" to the Web API.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-home-xml-04#section-4.3.1 "Read documentation for Link Relation &#34;home&#34;") (**[Internet Draft wilde-home-xml: Home Documents for HTTP Services: XML Syntax](/specs/IETF/I-D/wilde-home-xml "The specification for HTTP API Home Documents provides a JSON syntax only. This specification provides an XML syntax for the same data model, so that the concept of Home Documents can be consistently exposed in both JSON- and XML-based HTTP APIs. It also defines the link relation type &#34;home&#34; so that applications can identify links to home documents.")**)
