[In non-XML markup languages, the link element can be used to reference an external timesheet document.](http://www.w3.org/TR/timesheet#smilTimesheetsNS-Elements-Timesheet "Read documentation for Link Relation &#34;timesheet&#34;") (**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/timesheet: SMIL Timesheets 1.0](/specs/W3C/TR/timesheet "This document defines an XML timing language that makes SMIL 3.0 element and attribute timing control available to a wide range of other XML languages. This language allows SMIL timing to be integrated into a wide variety of a-temporal languages, even when several such languages are combined in a compound document. Because of its similarity with external style and positioning descriptions in the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) language, this functionality has been termed SMIL Timesheets.")**)
