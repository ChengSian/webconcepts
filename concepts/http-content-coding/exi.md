description: "The content-coding value \"exi\" is registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for use with EXI. Protocols that can identify and negotiate the content coding of XML information independent of its media type, SHOULD use the content coding \"exi\" (case-insensitive) to convey the acceptance or actual use of EXI encoding for XML information."

**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/exi: Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) Format 1.0](/specs/W3C/TR/exi "This document is the specification of the Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) format. EXI is a very compact representation for the Extensible Markup Language (XML) Information Set that is intended to simultaneously optimize performance and the utilization of computational resources. The EXI format uses a hybrid approach drawn from the information and formal language theories, plus practical techniques verified by measurements, for entropy encoding XML information. Using a relatively simple algorithm, which is amenable to fast and compact implementation, and a small set of datatype representations, it reliably produces efficient encodings of XML event streams. The grammar production system and format definition of EXI are presented."):** [The content-coding value "exi" is registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for use with EXI.
