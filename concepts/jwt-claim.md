JSON Web Token Claim | Specification
-------: | :-------
[`aud`](/concepts/jwt-claim/aud "The &#34;aud&#34; (audience) claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. Each principal intended to process the JWT MUST identify itself with a value in the audience claim.") | [**RFC 7519**: JSON Web Token (JWT)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7519 "JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.")
[`cnf`](/concepts/jwt-claim/cnf "The &#34;cnf&#34; claim is used in the JWT to contain members used to identify the proof-of-possession key.") | [**RFC 7800**: Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7800 "This specification describes how to declare in a JSON Web Token (JWT) that the presenter of the JWT possesses a particular proof-of-possession key and how the recipient can cryptographically confirm proof of possession of the key by the presenter. Being able to prove possession of a key is also sometimes described as the presenter being a holder-of-key.")
[`exp`](/concepts/jwt-claim/exp "The &#34;exp&#34; (expiration time) claim identifies the expiration time on or after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing. The processing of the &#34;exp&#34; claim requires that the current date/time MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the &#34;exp&#34; claim.") | [**RFC 7519**: JSON Web Token (JWT)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7519 "JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

[`iat`](/concepts/jwt-claim/iat "The &#34;iat&#34; (issued at) claim identifies the time at which the JWT was issued. This claim can be used to determine the age of the JWT.") | [**RFC 7519**: JSON Web Token (JWT)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7519 "JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

[`iss`](/concepts/jwt-claim/iss "The &#34;iss&#34; (issuer) claim identifies the principal that issued the JWT. The processing of this claim is generally application specific.") | [**RFC 7519**: JSON Web Token (JWT)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7519 "JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

[`jti`](/concepts/jwt-claim/jti "The &#34;jti&#34; (JWT ID) claim provides a unique identifier for the JWT. The identifier value MUST be assigned in a manner that ensures that there is a negligible probability that the same value will be accidentally assigned to a different data object; if the application uses multiple issuers, collisions MUST be prevented among values produced by different issuers as well.") | [**RFC 7519**: JSON Web Token (JWT)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7519 "JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

[`nbf`](/concepts/jwt-claim/nbf "The &#34;nbf&#34; (not before) claim identifies the time before which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing. The processing of the &#34;nbf&#34; claim requires that the current date/time MUST be after or equal to the not-before date/time listed in the &#34;nbf&#34; claim.") | [**RFC 7519**: JSON Web Token (JWT)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7519 "JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

[`sub`](/concepts/jwt-claim/sub "The &#34;sub&#34; (subject) claim identifies the principal that is the subject of the JWT. The claims in a JWT are normally statements about the subject. The subject value MUST either be scoped to be locally unique in the context of the issuer or be globally unique.") | [**RFC 7519**: JSON Web Token (JWT)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7519 "JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
