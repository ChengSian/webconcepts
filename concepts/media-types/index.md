Media Type | Description | Specification
-------: | :---------- | :---
`application/activity+json` | "[In the most basic sense, an "activity" is a semantic description of a potential or completed action. In the former case, the activity expresses what can or might be done with a particular object, while in the latter case, it expresses what has already been done. It is the goal of this specification to provide a JSON-based syntax that is sufficient to express metadata about activities in a rich, human-friendly, machine-processable and extensible manner. This may include constructing natural-language descriptions or visual representations about the activity, associating actionable information with various types of objects, communicating or recording activity logs, or delegation of potential actions to other applications.](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/activitystreams-core/#introduction)" | [**W3C TR activitystreams-core**: Activity Streams 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/)

`application/json` | "[JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a text format for the serialization of structured data. It is derived from the object literals of JavaScript, as defined in the ECMAScript Programming Language Standard, Third Edition. JSON can represent four primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans, and null) and two structured types (objects and arrays). A string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters. An object is an unordered collection of zero or more name/value pairs, where a name is a string and a value is a string, number, boolean, null, object, or array. An array is an ordered sequence of zero or more values. The terms "object" and "array" come from the conventions of JavaScript. JSON's design goals were for it to be minimal, portable, textual, and a subset of JavaScript.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-1)" | [**RFC 7159**: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159)
`application/ld+json` | "[Generally speaking, the data model used for JSON-LD is a labeled, directed graph. The graph contains nodes, which are connected by edges. A node is typically data such as a string, number, typed values (like dates and times) or an IRI. There is also a special class of node called a blank node, which is typically used to express data that does not have a global identifier like an IRI. Blank nodes are identified using a blank node identifier.](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#data-model-overview)" | [**W3C TR json-ld**: JSON-LD 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/)
