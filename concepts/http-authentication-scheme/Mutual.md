This scheme provides true mutual authentication between an HTTP client and an HTTP server using password-based authentication. Unlike the Basic and Digest authentication schemes, the Mutual authentication scheme specified in this document assures the user that the server truly knows the user's encrypted password."):** [The scheme provides true mutual authentication between an HTTP client and an HTTP server, using just a simple password as a credential.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpauth-mutual#section-2 "Read documentation for HTTP Authentication Scheme &#34;Mutual&#34;")
