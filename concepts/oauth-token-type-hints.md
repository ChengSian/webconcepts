-------: | :-------
[`access_token`](/concepts/oauth-token-type-hint/access_token) | [**RFC 7009**: OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation](/specs/IETF/RFC/7009 "This document proposes an additional endpoint for OAuth authorization servers, which allows clients to notify the authorization server that a previously obtained refresh or access token is no longer needed. This allows the authorization server to clean up security credentials.  A revocation request will invalidate the actual token and, if applicable, other tokens based on the same authorization grant.")
