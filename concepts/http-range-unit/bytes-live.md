**[Internet Draft pratt-httpbis-bytes-live-range-unit: HTTP bytes-live Range Unit for Live Content](/specs/IETF/I-D/pratt-httpbis-bytes-live-range-unit "To accommodate byte range requests for content that has data appended over time, this document defines a new HTTP range unit named &#34;bytes-live&#34;. The &#34;bytes-live&#34; range unit provides the ability for a client to specify a byte range in a GET or HEAD request which starts at an arbitrary byte offset within the representation and ends at an indeterminate offset, represented by &#34;*&#34;."):** [As with the "bytes" range unit, a "bytes-live" Range request allows a client to designate a subset of bytes from the representation data to be transferred in payloads as a sequence of octets. But the form of a "bytes-live" request is focused on accessing data that may be appended to the representation over time.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pratt-httpbis-bytes-live-range-unit#section-2 "Read documentation for HTTP Range Unit &#34;bytes-live&#34;")
