**[RFC 7233: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Range Requests](/specs/IETF/RFC/7233 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines range requests and the rules for constructing and combining responses to those requests."):** [Since representation data is transferred in payloads as a sequence of octets, a byte range is a meaningful substructure for any representation transferable over HTTP. The "bytes" range unit is defined for expressing subranges of the data's octet sequence.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233#section-2.1 "Read documentation for HTTP Range Unit &#34;bytes&#34;")
