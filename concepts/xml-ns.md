XML Namespace | Specification
-------: | :-------
[`urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:EmergencyCallData:control`](/concepts/xml-ns/urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:EmergencyCallData:control "This document defines a block of metadata/control data as an XML structure containing elements used for eCall and other related emergency call systems and extension points. The control block is an XML data structure allowing for acknowledgments, requests, and capabilities information. It is carried in a body part with a specific MIME media type.") | [**RFC 8147**: Next-Generation Pan-European eCall](/specs/IETF/RFC/8147 "This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms to support the next generation of the Pan-European in-vehicle emergency call service defined under the eSafety initiative of the European Commission (generally referred to as &#34;eCall&#34;). eCall is a standardized and mandated system for a special form of emergency calls placed by vehicles, providing real-time communications and an integrated set of related data. This document also registers MIME media types and an Emergency Call Data Type for the eCall vehicle data and metadata/control data, and an INFO package to enable carrying this data in SIP INFO requests. Although this specification is designed to meet the requirements of next-generation Pan-European eCall (NG-eCall), it is specified generically such that the technology can be reused or extended to suit requirements across jurisdictions.")
[`urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:common-policy`](/concepts/xml-ns/urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:common-policy "This document defines a framework for authorization policies controlling access to application-specific data. This framework combines common location- and presence-specific authorization aspects. An XML schema specifies the language in which common policy rules are represented. The common policy framework can be extended to other application domains.") | [**RFC 4745**: Common Policy: A Document Format for Expressing Privacy Preferences](/specs/IETF/RFC/4745 "This document defines a framework for authorization policies controlling access to application-specific data. This framework combines common location- and presence-specific authorization aspects. An XML schema specifies the language in which common policy rules are represented. The common policy framework can be extended to other application domains.")
[`urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:ECMLv2`](/concepts/xml-ns/urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:ECMLv2 "ECML (Electronic Commerce Modeling Language) provides a set of hierarchical payment-oriented data structures that will enable automated software, including electronic wallets from multiple vendors, to supply and query for needed data in a more uniform manner.") | [**RFC 4112**: Electronic Commerce Modeling Language (ECML) Version 2 Specification](/specs/IETF/RFC/4112 "Electronic commerce frequently requires a substantial exchange of information in order to complete a purchase or other transaction, especially the first time the parties communicate. A standard set of hierarchically-organized payment-related information field names in an XML syntax is defined so that this task can be more easily automated. This is the second version of an Electronic Commerce Modeling Language (ECML) and is intended to meet the requirements of RFC 3505.")
