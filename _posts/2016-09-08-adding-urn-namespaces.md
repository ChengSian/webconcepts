title:  "Adding URN Namespaces"
categories: update
---

While [URIs](/concepts/uri-schemes) are the foundational building block of identification on the Web, the "URN URI namespace" has its own recognition, and is managed through IANA as well. Technically, it's "just a URI scheme", but logically, it is one that is more openly managed than most others. For this reason, it makes sense to add [URN Namespaces](/concepts/urn-namespaces) as a new concept to [`webconcepts.info`](http://webconcepts.info).

The initial list of namespaces is very short, and it will be interesting to see how many of the IANA-registered namespaces are still popular enough to get added to this list over time. As usual, feel free to add via [PR (preferred)](https://github.com/dret/webconcepts/pulls), or [simply raise an issue](https://github.com/dret/webconcepts/issues) if you would like to see a URN namespace added.
