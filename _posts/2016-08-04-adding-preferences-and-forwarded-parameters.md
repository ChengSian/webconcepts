In a final push to close the [open issues about adding more Web Concepts](https://github.com/dret/webconcepts/issues), [HTTP Preferences](/concepts/http-preferences) (established by [RFC 7240](/specs/IETF/RFC/7240)) and [HTTP Forwarded Parameters](/concepts/http-forwarded-parameters) (established by [RFC 7239](/specs/IETF/RFC/7239)) are now part of [`webconcepts.info`](http://webconcepts.info).

Interestingly, both registries have no entries other than the ones established by the registry-defining specifications themselves. This often is a sign that a registry may not have been necessary, but that is sometimes hard to predict, and of course future specifications might very well add new values to those registries. For now, I would be interested in feedback if anybody has seen non-registered values being used for those parameters in the wild.
