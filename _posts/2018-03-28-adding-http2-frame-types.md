title:  "Adding HTTP/2 Frame Types"

Web Concepts is growing again! [RFC 7540](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540) establishes the [Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2 (HTTP/2) Parameter Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http2-parameters/http2-parameters.xhtml).  The RFC identifies three concepts ([Frame Type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http2-parameters/http2-parameters.xhtml#frame-type), [Settings](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http2-parameters/http2-parameters.xhtml#settings), and [Error Codes](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http2-parameters/http2-parameters.xhtml#error-code)), but for now only the frame type appears as a Web concept.

Therefore, the newest addition to the growing collection of [`webconcepts.info` concepts](/concepts/) are [*HTTP/2 Frame Types*](/concepts/http2-frame-type/) (which takes the total count of concepts to 33). As usual, [`webconcepts.info`](/) is not supposed to *only* reflect the official IANA registry, meaning that any other useful value should and will be added as well.
