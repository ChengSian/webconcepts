[RFC 7519](/specs/IETF/RFC/7519) and [RFC 7800](/specs/IETF/RFC/7800) establish two registries for *JSON Web Tokens (JWT)*. These have now been added to [`webconcepts.info`](http://webconcepts.info): The concept of [JSON Web Token Claims](/concepts/jwt-claims) and the concept of [JWT Confirmation Methods](/concepts/jwt-confirmation-methods). Both are fairly small value spaces for now, but that may change over time.

Adding these two concepts brought the overall number of [`webconcepts.info` concepts](/concepts/) to 503, passing the half-thousand mark for the first time. That's a fairly impressive number. It can be viewed as proof that managing these concepts in a structured and machine-readable way can help to serve as input for tooling and other areas where it is important to keep track of this big and evolving space.
