title:  "Adding URI Schemes and HTTP Transfer Codings"
categories: update
---

As part of ongoing work towards [the open issue about adding more Web Concepts](https://github.com/dret/webconcepts/issues/13), [URI Schemes](/concepts/uri-schemes) (established by [RFC 7595](/specs/IETF/RFC/7595)) and [HTTP Transfer Codings](/concepts/http-transfer-codings) (established by [RFC 7230](/specs/IETF/RFC/7230)) were added to [`webconcepts.info`](http://webconcepts.info).

While the [IANA HTTP Transfer Coding registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-parameters/http-parameters.xhtml#transfer-coding) is very small, the [IANA URI Scheme registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml) is (surprisingly) big, so for now only few URI schemes have been added to [`webconcepts.info`](http://webconcepts.info). Please [comment on the issue](https://github.com/dret/webconcepts/issues/23) (or just create a [PR](https://github.com/dret/webconcepts/pulls)) if you want to see specific URI schemes added.
