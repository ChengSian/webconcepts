Last week has seen a lot of updates of the new Web-based version on [`webconcepts.info`](http://webconcepts.info), so it's probably time to make people aware of it so that it's easier to figure out what to improve and fix.

The site already looks and works quite a bit better than the previous GitHub-only version. The peculiar mix of XSLT and Jekyll will not be to everybody's liking, but for now it gets the job done, and what matters in the end is not so much what's underneath the hood, but whether people find the idea and the site useful. I am curious to find out!
