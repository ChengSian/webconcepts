title:  "Adding Well-Known URIs"
categories: update
---

[RFC 5785](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785) establishes a registry for "[Well-Known URIs](http://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml)", which so far had not been a part of [`webconcepts.info`](http://webconcepts.info). [This has now been fixed](/concepts/well-known-uris), but more values still need to be added.

Well-known URIs arguably are not quite in line with a truly webby Web Architecture that uses hyperlinks to guide clients to resources. However, it is possible to look at them from the perspective of "hard-coded URI templates with the value space defined by a registry." While this is admittedly a slightly contrived way of looking at them, it might make them slightly more palatable to hypermedia purists.
