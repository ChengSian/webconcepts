After adding [HTTP Content Codings](/concepts/http-content-codings) it became clear that this required also a new class of specifications, because one of the specifications of registered values is [JSR 200](/specs/JCP/JSR/200 "Pack200: A Packed Class Deployment Format For Java Applications"). This was a great test to see how easy it is to add new specification organizations and series to [`webconcepts.info`](http://webconcepts.info), and luckily, it was quick and easy.

Starting today there now is the [Java Community Process (JCP) organization](/specs/JCP/) with [Java Specification Request (JSR)](/specs/JCP/JSR/) as their only series. There certainly are more JSR specifications to add than just [JSR 200](/specs/JCP/JSR/200 "Pack200: A Packed Class Deployment Format For Java Applications"), but it ws good to see that the model of [`webconcepts.info`](http://webconcepts.info) is relatively flexible.
