Thanks to feedback at [RESTfest 2016](https://2016.restfest.org/us/), there now is not only [JSON for all concepts and specifications](/update/2016/09/04/json-specs.html), but also individual JSON files for each concept value (for example, here is [the JSON for 404](/concepts/http-status-code/404.json)).

This means that there now is JSON available for three different things:

* [JSON for all specifications](/specs/specs.json)
* [JSON for all concepts](/concepts/concepts.json)
* JSON per Web Concept value (such as [HTTP Status Code 404](/concepts/http-status-code/404.json))

Enjoy, and as usual, feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/dret/webconcepts/issues) if there is something you would like to do that currently does not work or is not available.
