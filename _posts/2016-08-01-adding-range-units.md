title:  "Adding HTTP Range Units"

[RFC 7233](/specs/IETF/RFC/7233) establishes a registry for the [`Accept-Ranges` HTTP header field](/concepts/http-header/Accept-Ranges) which so far had not been added to [`webconcepts.info`](http://webconcepts.info): The concept of [HTTP Range Units](/concepts/http-range-units).

This concept now has been added, even though in comparison to some others it is a fairly limited value space: So far it just contains the two values established by RFC 7233, and one proposed by [Internet Draft pratt-httpbis-bytes-live-range-unit](/specs/IETF/I-D/pratt-httpbis-bytes-live-range-unit).
