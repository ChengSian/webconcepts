title:  "Minor Refactoring of JSON"
categories: update
---

Time for spring cleaning! A few resources have been moved around on `webconcepts.info`. Most of it has been internal reorganization to better separate the [generated specification pages](/specs/) from the [sources](https://github.com/dret/webconcepts/tree/gh-pages/src). However, as part of this separation, the JSON document representing all specifications has been moved to the top level, to match the location of the [JSON document representing all concepts](/concepts.json). If you are using this JSON document, please change your links (the [JSON documentation](/JSON-specs) has been updated accordingly).

* The new location for [the JSON document representing all specifications is `/specs.json`](/specs.json).

I hope this makes `webconcepts.info` a little bit easier to understand, should you ever bother to look at the sources. As usual, [please provide feedback](https://github.com/dret/webconcepts/issues/) if you have any questions or comments.
