title:  "Adding HTTP Content Codings"
categories: update
---

The publication of the [Brotli compression method RFC 7932](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7932) today seemed like a good opportunity to add one of the missing concepts: [HTTP Content Codings](/concepts/http-content-codings).

The list of registered HTTP content codings in the [respective IANA registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-parameters/http-parameters.xhtml#content-coding) is relatively short and these values will be added to [`webconcepts.info`](http://webconcepts.info) shortly. More interesting is the question whether there are other values in use that are not properly registered, but still make sense to be added to list of well-known *Web Concepts*. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated!
