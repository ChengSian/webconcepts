This week I am at the wonderful [RESTfest 2016](https://2016.restfest.org/us/), spending three days with API and Web geeks. I have been invited to give the keynote, and as one part of that, I will start advertising [`webconcepts.info`](http://webconcepts.info) a bit more widely.

[`webconcepts.info`](http://webconcepts.info) still is work in progress, because some issues still need to be figured out, such as how to safely "reference" Web concepts from your own services, and how to safely add concepts while still maintaining the upstream connection.

Having more people using Web concepts doubtlessly will help to make some of these decisions, and hopefully will also [raise new issues](https://github.com/dret/webconcepts/issues) that can be used to further improve the site and its underlying model. For now, please have a look at the ["Deconstructing the Web" keynote slides](http://dret.net/lectures/restfest-2016/), and I will make the video of the keynote available as soon as it is published.
