title:  "Adding Structured Syntax Suffixes"
categories: update
---

The newest addition to the growing collection of [`webconcepts.info` concepts](/concepts/) are [*Structured Syntax Suffixes*](/concepts/structured-syntax-suffix/). This new concept currently lists 9 values, most of which are from the [respective IANA registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-type-structured-suffix/media-type-structured-suffix.xhtml).

As usual, feedback is greatly appreciated, in particular if you are using Structured Syntax Suffixes or have seen Structured Syntax Suffixes being used in ways which are not (yet) covered by the values listed so far.
