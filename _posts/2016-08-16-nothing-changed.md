Over the last couple of days, the XSLT code for [`webconcepts.info`](http://webconcepts.info) was changed fairly radically. Most importantly, the sources for the compiled information now all live in a single place, and there is no more "magical directory name" that decides how a specification is categorized.

Like all code refactoring, this rewrite of how the site works should be entirely invisible for anybody visiting the Web site. However, it should make it easier for the ongoing efforts to use [`webconcepts.info`](http://webconcepts.info) as a way to manage and group and reuse specification modules that are then used to compile a consolidated directory of *Web Concepts*.
