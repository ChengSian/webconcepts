There now is documentation for how *Web Concepts* are made available as JSON data. The [JSON documentation](/JSON) provides an overview of how Web Concepts are made available as two general JSON documents: Specification data and concept data.

* The [documentation for specification data](/JSON-specs) describes how the specifications [available from the specifications page](/specs/) are represented [as a JSON document](/specs.json).

* The [documentation for concept data (concepts and values)](/JSON-concepts) describes how concepts and concept values [available from the concepts page](/concepts/) are  represented [as a JSON document](/concepts.json).

I hope this documentation help to make Web Concepts easier to use, and as usual, [please provide feedback](https://github.com/dret/webconcepts/issues/) if you have any questions or comments.
