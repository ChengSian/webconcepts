Today marks the start of migrating the existing [GitHub site](https://github.com/dret/webconcepts) (which used to be called "sedola" but now has been renamed to "webconcepts") to the new site [`webconcepts.info`](http://webconcepts.info).

Creating the new site with listings of specifications and concepts will take a bit of time, but at least the site is up and running as a Jekyll-based Web site.
