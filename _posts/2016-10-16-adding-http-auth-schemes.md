title:  "Adding HTTP Authentication Schemes"
categories: update
---

The newest addition to the growing collection of [`webconcepts.info` concepts](/concepts/) are [*HTTP Authentication Schemes*](/concepts/http-authentication-scheme). This new concept currently lists the 8 registered values from the [respective IANA registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-authschemes/http-authschemes.xhtml#authschemes).

As usual, feedback is greatly appreciated, in particular if you are using HTTP Authentication or have seen HTTP Authentication being used in ways which are not (yet) covered by the values listed so far.
