*Web Concepts* are proud to make an appearance at [Craft 2018](https://craft-conf.com/)! There will be a presentation at the [Craft Conference Special Edition Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Craft-meetup/events/250410838/) on May 9, 2018. Since the topic will be the same, the [WWW2018](https://www2018.thewebconf.org/) paper still is a useful companion for the presentation, and is linked below as well.
