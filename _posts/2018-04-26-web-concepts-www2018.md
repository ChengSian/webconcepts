*Web Concepts* are proud to make an appearance at the [27th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW2018)](https://www2018.thewebconf.org/)! Part of WWW2018 is the [Developers' Track](https://www2018.thewebconf.org/program/developers-track/), and a paper about Web Concepts has been accepted for that tracks. This means that now there is a published paper about Web Concepts, as well as a presentation:

* Paper: [Erik Wilde, "Surfing the API Web: Web Concepts", 27th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW2018), Lyon, France, April 2018](http://dret.net/netdret/docs/wilde-www2018-web-concepts.pdf)
* Presentation: ["Surfing the API Web: Web Concepts", WWW2018 Developers' Track, Erik Wilde, April 26, 2018](http://dret.net/lectures/www-2018/)

For now, the home page simply links to this update to allow people to find the paper. When I have time for a bigger update, I probably should start working on a documentation section that would have been a useful addition quite a while ago anyway. Don't hold your breath, though...
